Since beginning production in April of 1981 the\nDVWTP has provided a high quality of safe drinking water to the customers of the Duchesne Valley area.  \n\nContinuing efforts to consistently maintain the high quality and safety of the water provided\nto the residents in our area served, the DVWTP uses Chlorine to disinfect the drinking water prior\nto delivery into the service area.  Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant. It has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years, reducing or eliminating the risk of such water borne diseases as cholera, typhoid and dysentery. The chlorine we use is stored here at our facility. The chlorine is delivered to the DVWTP in one ton containers and is injected into the water system direct from these containers.  The DVWTP personnel recognize the important protection that chlorine provides in our drinking water, but at the same time, we recognize the hazards that chlorine can present if not handled and used properly and safely.\n\nIn order to be responsible to the residents in our area and protect them from possible harm in the\nevent of an unexpected release of chlorine , the DVWTP, using United States Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) requirements and modeling guidelines, modeled two possible situations.\nThe first situation, or worst case scenario, involved the most massive of all possibilities and the\nsecond scenario represented a more reasonable possibility of what might happen in an unexpected\nrelease.\n\nThe first situation, or worse case scenario, is based on the complete dumping of a full one ton\ncontainer of liquid chlorine within a ten minute period of time.

This would most likely\nrequire the evacuation of about twenty residents in the area.  The second situation, a more\nreasonable scenario of what might happen, would be contained within a radius of less than 320\nfeet and would likely not affect any residents in the area.\n\nThe DVWTP has a written Emergency Response Plan for use  in the unlikely possibility that an unexpected chlorine release would threaten to spread beyond the plant boundaries. Copies of this plan has been filed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Duchense County/Duchesne City Fire Department for their use in assistance if the need should arise. The DVWTP is cooperating fully with all local agencies in their efforts to maintain the safety of all area residents. The DVWTP also has written Emergency Action Plans that covers employee actions to contain an unexpected chlorine release within the plant boundaries.\n\nDVWTP personnel recognize that well maintained and inspected equipment is one of the best ways to\navoid a chlorine release problem.  DVWTP has complete written maintenance and inspection\nprograms to fully cover the chlorination process at the water plant.  Each ton container of\nchlorine is completely inspected for possible defects or problems prior to acceptance for delivery. \nAll DVWTP employees are involved in ongoing training on handling and using chlorine as well as\ncomplete training in safely containing a possible chlorine release.  The DVWTP also incorporates the\nuse of constant monitoring equipment in all areas where the chlorine is stored or used.  This\nequipment is designed to sense the presence of chlorine in the atmosphere and give visual and\naudible alarms in the event of an unexpected release.  \n\nDVWTP maintains up-to-date protective equipment assigned to each employee to be used in an\nemergency as needed.

All employees are\nregularly trained in actual use of all equipment and protective gear in order to be familiar with it's\nuse.\n\nIn the 17 year history of the DVWTP, there has been no incident of any type involving chlorine or the\nrelease of chlorine into the atmosphere.  DVWTP recognizes the great benefits that the use of\nchlorine provides to the production of a safe drinking water.  The AVWTP employees also recognize\nthe need for constant vigilance, as well as constant training, in the use of any hazardous material. Over the last few years we've worked hard at building what we call a Layers of Protection approach to safety. That means that we routinely evaluate and update our equipment, training and procedures. And now, throuogh the RMP, local emergency responders and other community authorities have become an important part of our risk management process."
