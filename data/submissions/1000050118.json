Accidental Release Prevention Policy\r\nThe Town of Ocean City Division of Public Works accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the US EPA Prevention Program are adhered too.  The Division of Public Works, Risk Management and Emergency Management continue to evaluate and improve its procedures and practices with regards to its accidental release prevention policy.\r\n\r\n\tThe Division of Public Works and Emergency Management response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\r\n\r\nB. System Description and Regulated Substance Handled\r\nThe 44th Street Water Treatment Plant provides the Town of Ocean City with potable (drinking) water.  The 44th Street Water Treatment Plant is located on 44th Street Bayside, west of Coastal Highway, in Ocean City, Maryland.  Disinfection of water is part of the water treatment process required by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the State of Maryland.  At the 44th Street (WTP), disinfection is accomplished with chlorine treatment.\r\n\tChlorine gas is stored and handled at the 44th Street WTP for disinfection process.  The WTP chlorination system has a chlorine storage room and a chlorination room.  Equipment at the facility includes gas chlorine cylinders, chlorine gas manifolds, a vacuum feed system, chlorinators, safety equipment, chlorine leak detectors and an emergency scrubber system.\r\n\tTypically twenty (20) one-fifty pound cylinders are on site.  Six (6) of the twenty (20) cylinders are hook-up online and six (6) of the twenty cylinders are hook-up in back.  The WTP is normally unmanned when on-line.  (Note this plant does not operate year round).  WTP operators visit the facility daily"

Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as \"Worst-Case Release and \"Alternative Scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, stating that, \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel, one-ton container, is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Release Scenario.\"  The Offsite Consequence Analysis for the 44th Street WTP was conducted with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Water Treatment Plants.\r\n1. Based on the tables and information provided for a worst-case chlorine release, the following was determined:\r\ni. The \"Worst-Case Release Scenario,\" as defined by EPA, would be for three (3) 150 lb cylinders of chlorine to release, as a gas, in a ten-minute period.\r\nii. The toxic endpoint for the chlorine gas is 3 ppm.\r\niii. Passive mitigation can be expected from the building housing the chlorine and this will reduce the release rate by 45%.\r\niv. The distance from the release site to the toxic endpoint is 0.45miles  (It should be noted that the design of the chlorine feed system [vacuum feed] and the presence of an emergency scrubber system make the possibility of the EPA described \"worst-case\" scenario practically impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The \"Alternative (Release) Scenario\" was evaluated with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  For the 44th Street WTP a possible alternative release scenario would be a pressure relief valve release through a 1/8-inch i.d. chlorine gas stainless steel flexible connector.  Such a leak would not have an impact outside the facility boundaries.  The reason for this is because of the active mitigation measures that are in place.  These are:\r\ni. Va"

The general 44th Street WTP accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are based on the Town of Ocean City's program and consists of the following key elements:\r\n1. Highly skilled and trained operators (State licensed)\r\n2. Preventive Maintenance Program\r\n3. Use of State -of-the-art process and safety equipment\r\n4.

The program includes an organizational structure of emergency responders and their responsibilities.  Emergency response to a leak at the 44th Street WTP would include selected and trained personnel from all the Public Works and Public Safety Groups.
