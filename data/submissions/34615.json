      "SummaryText": "HUNTSMAN LLC - Aromatics and Olefins (A&O) Plant - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  Huntsman Aromatics and Olefins (A&O) Plant is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  This is exemplified by the A&O Plant having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) VPP Star Award for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman A&O Plant maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman A&O Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Port Arthur Fire Department and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Huntsman has participated in the past with the Responsible Care\u00ae initiative ACC, is committed to the responsible management of chemicals and is an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.   The Plant Manager of the A&O Plant is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP).\n\n2.  Regulated Substances.   The Aromatics and Olefins Plant is located on 230 acres at the corner of State Highway 73 and Savanna Avenue in Port Arthur, Texas and employs 184 people.  The site first opened in 1957 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994.  The site produces as primary end products ethylene, propylene, cyclohexane and intermediates.  The A&O Plant has four processes:  the Light Olefins Unit (LOU) manufactures ethylene and propylene; the Aromatics/Cyclohexane Unit manufactures aromatics extract and cyclohexane; Utilities uses chlorine for water treatment; and the offsite tankage area operated by an adjoining plant, is included in t"

This includes information pertaining to: \n? Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure, and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\nEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nHuntsman\u00bfs A&O Plant has performed process hazard analysis (PHA) on each process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The A&O Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The A&O Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure for the LOU and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \nOperating Procedures\nHuntsman A&O Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.

The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \nTraining\nHuntsman A&O Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \nMechanical Integrity\nHuntsman A&O Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \nManagement of Change\nHuntsman A&O Plant has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.

Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n \nIncident Investigation\nHuntsman A&O Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman A&O Plant has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman A&O Plant has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.

Huntsman A&O Plant ensures that all employees have access to PHA\u00bfs and all other process safety management information.\n \nHot Work Permit\nHuntsman A&O Plant employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near a covered process, Huntsman A&O Plant issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot work permits are kept on file until the work is complete.\n \nContractors\nHuntsman A&O Plant has developed procedures for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.  Huntsman A&O Plant provides information to contractors about the hazards that may be present in the work area and has developed appropriate safe work practices.  Huntsman A&O Plant also evaluates the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\n \n4.  Five Year Accident History.
