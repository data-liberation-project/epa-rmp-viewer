The anhydrous ammonia tanks are located at the rear of the property, where they are unlikely to be struck by vehicles.  The propane tanks are totally enclosed by chain-link fence.  \n\nActive prevention measures include inspection of all tanks annually, at the end of the season.  All required repairs are completed prior to further use.  Further inspections are preformed semi-annually by the Missouri Department of Agriculture.\n\nEmergency response policies are as described below.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is located on the southwest edge of Sedalia, Missouri, and supplies fertilizers, propane and other materials to farmers.  The facility has two bulk anhydrous ammonia tanks with capacities of 26,000 gallons and 11,000 gallons.  There are also two Liquefied Petroleum Gas tanks, each having a capacity of 18,000 gallons.  The facility also stores dry fertilizer.  \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the ammonia operation envisions a catastrophic failure of the storage tank, possibly preceded by failure of the safety relief valve.  Regulatory and procedural controls limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank to approximately 85% to 88% of capacity.  Using RMP*COMP, the toxic endpoint was calculated to be at 3.6 miles.  This would include virtually the entire city of Sedalia.  The same type of failure could occur with the LP tanks.  In the presence of an ignition source, this could lead to a vapor cloud explosion.  The endpoint for this event was calculated to be 0.3 miles.\n\nAlternative release scenarios for both products involve hose being broken or damaged, allowing product release.  The relea"

      "SummaryText": "se of the LPG in the presence of an ignition source would also result in a vapor cloud explosion.  Both of these events could occur only in conjunction with failure of the excess flow valves.  The toxic endpoint for an anhydrous ammonia release is 0.5 miles, and for the propane release is 0.2 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe facility complies with both 29 CFR 1910.111 (Anhydrous Ammonia) and NFPA 58 (Propane).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have no accidents involving releases of anhydrous ammonia or LP gas in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is located within the city limits of Sedalia, Missouri.  Employees will notify the fire department in the event of a major release.  The General Manager and other designated employees are authorized to take appropriate actions to stop small releases by shutting off valves, etc.  Other employees will notify the fire department, and evacuate the area as necessary.
