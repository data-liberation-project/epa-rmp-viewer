      "SummaryText": "The owners, management, and employees of The Farmers Cooperative & Mercantile Assn. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the releases to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the anhydrous plant is to receive by truck anhydrous ammonia, store the ammonia and transfer the ammonia into nurse tanks which will be used by our customers to enhance the growing of agricultural commodities such has wheat. The maximum quantity stored would be 53,000 pounds in our storage tank. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released has a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by designed standards. The distance to the endpoint in the worst case scenario (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.63 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .83 miles.\n\nBoth the Federal Government and the State of Kansas heavily regulate our facility. OSHA, EPA, DOT and the Kansas Department of Agriculture all regulate our facilities and we our best to satisfy not only these regulators but also meet industry standards and our own high standards. Our efforts go beyond the typical training required for agricultural facilities because of the volunteer commitments our employees have made. All of these efforts have paid dividends to our firm. Our goal is to continue to strive for a safe workplace for our employees, communities in which we operate and for the farmer owners we serve."
