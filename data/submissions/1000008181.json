The facility has an ongoing effort to identify hazards, review safety techniques, and implement employee training through operation,\nmaintenance and inspection procedures to manage the risk of a chlorine\ngas release.\n\nB.\tThe Township of Hampton, Allison Park treatment facility was originally placed into operation in 1971.  The facility was expanded both in 1986 and 1992.  The facility currently has the capacity of treating 3.2 million gallons per day of wastewater.  Gaseous chlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is utilized to disinfect\nthe effluent prior to discharging to the receiving water.  The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton containers, with no more that 2,500 pounds on site at any given time. The chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted and are designed for conveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine system is inspected daily by the wastewater treatment plant operating personnel.  The facility is manned approximately 8.5 hours per day.\n\nC.\tIn general, the Allison Park Treatment Facility's accidental release prevention program is based on the following:\n\n\t- Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n\t- Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n\t- Preparation of written operating procedures for safely\n\t  conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n\t- Implementation of employee training program\n\t- Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques\n\t  and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, the Department of Environmental Services will perform a compliance audit at least once every 3 years.

      "SummaryText": "compliance audit will include a review of all aspects of the risk management program in conjunction with corrective actions if any deficiencies exist.  Written documentation of the audit will be\nmaintained on-site.\n\nAny incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine will be investigated immediately.  A summary of the investigation and corrective actions will be documented and maintained at the treatment facility.\n\nChemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having the appropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection device, self-contained breathing apparatuses, chemical resistant suits and gloves, and a ton-cylinder repair kit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees relative to acceptable operating and handling techniques of chlorine gas.\n\nD.\tThe facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of Allegheny County's written emergency response plan. Release response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation procedures, and training exercises are included within the plan.  The public is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as soon as a release occurs.  Evacuation route has been mapped within the plan.  The plan is reviewed/updated annually by the facility emergency coordinator.\n\nThe Allison Park WPCP employees will not respond to accidental releases of chlorine gas.  Emergency responders will include the local fire department, police department, emergency medical service, and HAZMAT team.\n\nF.\tThe facility is currently working on an extensive procedure on changing chlorine cylinders.  The purpose of this procedure is to insure the safety of all employees involved.  This procedure will require employees changing cylinders to wear chlorine resistant suits and gloves, as well as full utilization of the new SCBA's on site."
