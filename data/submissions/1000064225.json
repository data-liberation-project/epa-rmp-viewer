      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nSand Springs Water Treatment Plant\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nJune 2017 Update\n\n\n\nThe Sand Springs Water Treatment Plant (SSWTP) uses chlorine (Cl2) to disinfect processed\n\nwater and sustain the quality of the water throughout the distribution system. The quantity of Cl2\n\nmaintained on-site for this purpose exceeds the threshold limit as defined by the Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (EPA), 40 CFR, Part 68, under Section 112 ( r ) of the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe City of Sand Springs and its facilities are devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of\n\nhazardous chemicals. This is evident by the established training procedures utilized by the City\n\npersonnel.\n\n\n\nThe SSWTP supplies drinking water to both Sand Springs residents and rural water districts.\n\nThe treatment process is designed for a production capacity of 10 mgd. Normal daily operation\n\ntreats 4 to 6 mgd. Chlorine is used to inactivate pathogenic organisms in the treated water before\n\ndistribution and to maintain a chlorine residual within the distribution system to protect the water\n\nquality. The chlorine supply is pulled into the process from one-ton containers under a vacuum.\n\nThe presence of the vacuum prevents gas from escaping into the atmosphere incase of potential\n\nfailure downstream of the vacuum regulator. This vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which\n\nare mounted directly to the ton containers, eliminating gaseous pressure piping in the system.\n\nThe gas is then mixed into a water solution and fed into the treatment.\n\n\n\nThe impact areas for both the worst case and alternate release scenarios were based on the results\n\nfrom the software program ALHOA developed by NOAA. The worst case release scenario\n\nconsidered a one-ton release within a 10-minute period. This resulted in a 2.6-mile radius, which\n\ncould impact an estimated population of 17,063 persons. No active or inactive mitigation was\n\nconsidered in this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario was based on a gas relea"

      "SummaryText": "se created by improper sealing of a\n\nleaking or broken valve. No gas is able to escape downstream of the regulators due to the\n\nvacuum feed method from the one-ton container since the rest of the system operates either\n\nunder a vacuum or in a solution. A valve break at the container could result in a release rate of\n\n15 lbs/min of Cl2. The impact area of this release was determined by ALHOA to have a radius\n\nof 1009 yards (0.6 miles), and approximately 542 people within the release impacted area.\n\nThe chlorine system components at the plant comply with one or more of the following\n\nstandards: AWWA Standards, Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality Regulations,\n\nASTM Standards, ANSI Standards, and ASME Standards. In addition, consistent maintenance\n\nand regular training sessions will minimize the potential for a toxic release.\n\n\n\nIf a release were to occur, then the chlorine gas detectors would notify plant by sounding an\n\nalarm. For a small leak with no potential safety or health hazard, plant personnel would stop the\n\nleak using personal protective equipment (PPE). If unable to stop the leak or if the leak is substantial posing health or safety hazard, then City personnel would contact local City of sand\n\nSprings Fir Department, Advance Chemical, police and other city staff respectively. Other\n\nregulatory agencies would be contacted as required. The local Emergency Planning and\n\nResponse Team work with plant personnel to minimize the impact of the release by training and\n\ninitiating drills to verify preparedness as drilled in accordance with the county emergency\n\nresponse procedure manual.\n\n"
