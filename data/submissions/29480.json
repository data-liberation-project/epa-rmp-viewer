The company's officers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\nSofo Foods has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of regulated substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of regulated hazardous material releases are set forth in our Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, our Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to and reporting such releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes an Incident Command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services to ensure safety of the public.  Sofo Foods will call in emergency public responders that will provide emergency response in case of a release.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nSofo Foods is located in Toledo, Ohio and is primarily engaged in the merchant wholesale distribution of groceries and related products including packaged frozen food, dairy products, and meat products.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant within the refrigeration system to cool or freeze product.  Ammonia refrigeration is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Liquid ammonia is changed to a gas and then condensed for reuse.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nSofo Foods has developed models of the releases at this facility and the potential affected areas.  Commercially available computer software was used to develop the release scenarios and determine off-site areas that could be affected should a release occurs.\n\nThe worst-case release of ammonia involves the sudden failure of +10?

This type of release is not likely to occur because of the stringent construction codes for pressure vessels and inspections of the pressure vessels.\n\nThe alternative release of ammonia involves the failure of a 3/4 inch relief valve on an Evaporative Condenser, releasing approximately 1,700 pounds of ammonia gas over a thirty minute period.  Residences and businesses within a radius of 0.19 mile could be affected by this type of release.  This release scenario was selected because relief valve springs could fail if not maintained.  A periodic relief valve replacement program is in place to prevent this type of accidental release from occurring.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nSofo Foods has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The company has  developed programs and policies to minimize the possibility of releases.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\n\nSafety Improvements\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include: improved maintenance procedures and periodicity; and continued training of plant personnel."
