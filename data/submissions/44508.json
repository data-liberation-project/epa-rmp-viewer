XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\n\nPRCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Whelan Plant, located near Harleton, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at Whelan.  The facility is a refrigeration unit using compressed propane to cool the incoming gas stream.  This liberates natural gas liquids which are separated in the three phase separator then stabilized in a tower using the glycol still as a heat source.  The stabilized liquids are stored and trucked to delivery.  The glycol is also used to inhibit freezing by injecting it into the inlet stream. The glycol is recovered in the three-phase separator and sent to the still to regenerate.  The gas off the three phase separator is cross exchanged with the inlet then sent to sales.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 2 proceses at the Whelan Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 30,000 gallons (159,000 lbs.).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.45 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measur"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is also 0.45 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Whelan Plant. It is a small, unmanned skid-mounted natural gas refrigeration plant. The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 2.  The plant has more than a threshold quantity of flammable chemicals, e.g. natural gas and NGLs, in a  process.  The Whelan Plant is an entirely new facility but a small number of receptors are present within the distance to the worst-case release endpoint.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Whelan Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nHazard Analysis\n\nThe Whelan Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by a company engineer with maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise of this type of facility. He analyzes and evaluates hazards of the processes, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when he believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe hazardous analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution.

All approved mitigation options in response to the engineer's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  Once the engineer's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Whelan Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\n\nIn addition, the Whelan Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Whelan Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help to ensure that equipment function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing  the equipment back in service (if possible), or an engineer will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSecurity\n\nThe Whelan Plant uses a locked gate to control the entry and exit of XTO and contractor personnel.\n\nIncident Investigation  \n\nThe Whelan Plant"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigtion reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard analyses.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Whelan Plant conducts an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit staff members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Whelan management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in resopnse to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
