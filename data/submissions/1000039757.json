      "SummaryText": "Lindau Chemicals, Inc. is a specialty organic chemical manufacturer. Lindau supplies raw materials to many different industries throughout the world. The primary products produced are anhydride curing agents for epoxy resins. These curing agents are used to manufacture composite materials, electrical and electronic components, and many other products. Other products manufactured include coating resins used in concrete and masonry paints and special polymers and additives for the curing agent products.\r\n\r\nThe EPA risk management regulations apply to two flammable substances handled onsite, Butadiene and Isoprene. Both of these materials are essential raw materials for Lindau products and both have been used in our process for over 40 years without serious incident. This risk management plan (RMP) covers the storage and use of these two materials at Lindau. Both of these materials are flammable and that is the hazard for which the materials are listed. Isoprene is used in greater quantities and so a larger amount of isoprene is generally onsite. Other materials used at Lindau are either not listed in the risk management regulations or are present in quantities below threshold amounts.\r\n\r\nLindau Chemicals, Inc. operates its manufacturing facilities and processes in a safe and proper manner. We have an effective and continuous safety and environmental program incorporating procedures maintained to teach safety, correct deficiencies, and provide a safe, clean working environment, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. All company supervisors, managers, and officers are responsible for the enforcement of safety and environmental policies and practices.\r\n\r\nLindau Chemicals has a thorough Process Safety Management Program to help prevent accidental releases and fires. The program details our procedures for analyzing process hazards and implementing improvements to process procedures. The program includes procedures for safety analyses of processes, called Proc"

Potential releases and accidents have been identified through the Process Hazard Analysis as well as an evaluation of safeguards used to prevent accidents. The safety management program also includes a mechanical integrity program for all process equipment including the storage tanks and transfer hoses. Included in this program is a testing procedure to inspect and test equipment used for processing Isoprene or Butadiene on a regular basis. These procedures exceed generally recognized good industry practices and we believe are very effective in preventing accidents. \r\n\r\nDuring the past five years there have been no reportable incidents involving any risk management regulated materials. Lindau Chemicals has never had any incidents involving either Butadiene or Isoprene that caused property damage, injuries or evacuations off site. \r\n\r\nLindau Chemicals, Inc. has an comprehensive Emergency Response Plan which details response procedures to spills, fires and other emergencies. We maintain a close working relationship between Lindau's trained Hazardous Materials responders and the Columbia Fire Department. Firefighters have regularly visited Lindau's facility to become familiar with the layout and materials present. Lindau employees are trained regularly on emergency response procedures and notification procedures. Lindau Chemicals, Inc. is a member of the Richland County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management Program includes procedures for continuously reviewing and improving the safety of all production processes. Included are periodic reviews of procedures and investigations of all near miss incidents.
