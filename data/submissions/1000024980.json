Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Azle Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant employs six (6) full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility.  \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in December 2011 for the Azle Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE "

      "SummaryText": "POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.    \n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a NGL or propane release.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant processes NGL in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves. NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility at any given time is 60,742 gallons (238,248 lbs).  The largest vessel containing NGL at the facility is 53,269 gallons (208,936 lbs).\n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant also utilizes propane, a regulated flammable substance, as part of the process. The propane is handled in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves. The maximum inventory of propane at the facility at any given time is 7,453 gallons (31,348 lbs).  The largest vessel containing propane at the facility is 4,404 gallons (18,523 lbs).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL or propane. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. The Azle Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation, \n\n?    Process Safety "

The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\n?    Public and emergency response agency notification procedures; \n\n?    Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \n\n?    Emergency response measures; \n\n?    Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \n\n?    Employee training; and \n\n?    Program review procedures. \n\n\n\nThe Azle Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Parker County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Parker County Sheriff's Department. The Parker County Sheriff's Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL and/or propane release.  For these reasons, the Azle Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the facility is not required to h"
