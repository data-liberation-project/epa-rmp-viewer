      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Tembec BTLSR Inc facility (Tembec BTLSR)  utilizes more than the threshold quantity of formaldehyde solution (15,000 pounds) in the resin manufacturing process, therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in A?68.150. \n\nThe Tembec BTLSR facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\nTembec BTLSR first submitted a RMP to USEPA in 1999.  RMP's must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  The following information summarizes the Tembec BTLSR 2009 update and resubmission.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nTembec BTLSR maintains a policy of safe resin manufacturing operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the manufacturing processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment.   \n\nThe Tembec BTLSR facility has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with off site responders that are to be followed in the event of a formaldehyde leak.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nTembec BTLSR facility consists of three main locations where formaldehyde (45% by weight solution) is handled: unloading area outside the facility; a storage tank, and; reactors in which formaldehyde is mixed with urea or melamine to manufacture liquid resins.  \n \nThe formaldehyde solution is delivered to Tembec BTLSR by tanker truck and is stored in a single storage tank, which is only filled when an entire delivery can be received due to administrative controls.  \n\nThe facility also includes liquid feed piping, miscellaneou"

During this period of time, no accidental releases of formaldehyde solution occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTembec BTLSR maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of formaldehyde solution.  As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR Part 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA PSM. Required elements include\n \n1. Employee Participation\nTembec BTLSR attempts to ensure employees and their representatives actively participate in the risk management program.  As noted, employees participated in the process hazard analysis and compliance audit.\n\n2. Process Safety Information\nTembec BTLSR has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at the facility.  The information is made available to employees and contractors who will work in or about the formaldehyde solution process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) of the formaldehyde solution processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  A PHA was facilitated by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. using the What If/Checklist method with the assistance of Tembec BTLSR plant management and staff familiar with the process, operations and maintenance activities at the facility in May-June 2009.  The results of this review identified a number of changes in operating, "

The changes that most effectively help prevent an accidental release have been implemented or will be implemented by June 11, 2010.\n\n4. Operating Procedures\nTembec BTLSR has developed and implemented operating procedures that provide instructions and step for conducting activities associated with the formaldehyde solution processes consistent with the safety information.  BTLSR operating procedures include startup, shutdown, temporary, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release.  The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n5. Training\nAll Tembec BTLSR staff currently involved in formaldehyde solution processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Tembec BTLSR staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n5. Contractors\nTembec BTLSR has a contractor safety program for all operations at the facility, including on or near the formaldehyde solution process.\n\n6. Pre-startup Review\nThere has been one change to the Tembec BTLSR facility that has required a pre-startup safety review.  This review involved adding a check valve to the unloading system to prevent backflow into the unloading dike.  In the future, necessary changes will be accompanied by a review that will be performed following criteria identified in the Tembec BTLSR risk management program.\n\n7. Mechanical Integrity\nTembec BTLSR has a preventive and corrective maintenance "

The program will address equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n8. Hot Work\nTembec BTLSR has a hot work permit system in place for all hot work operations at the facility, including on or near the formaldehyde solution process.\n\n9. Management of Change\nTembec BTLSR has written procedures to manage changes to formaldehyde solution processes, equipment and procedures.\n\n10. Incident Investigation\nTembec BTLSR management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of formaldehyde solution.  A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Tembec BTLSR risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.  The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\n11. Compliance audits\nUSEPA's risk management rule requires that Tembec BTLSR complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years.  The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety or program deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among Tembec BTLSR staff.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nTembec BTLSR has an"

The Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR 68.90 (b), and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.   The facility has coordinated the plan with the Lucas County LEPC and the Toledo Fire Department, and is included in the written community response plan.  The Toledo Fire Department is designated as the first responders in the event of more than an incidental formaldehyde solution release.  \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis which was conducted in June 2009.  All safety improvements have been made.  Additional recommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the Process Hazard Analysis is updated every five years or when a major process change is made."
