As part of this commitment, the Altamont facility has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at El Paso and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA'S) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accident Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\r\n\r\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Altamont.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Altamont.\r\n\r\nThe RMP program at Altamont consists of three (3) elements:\r\n1) A hazard assessment to help understand:\r\n\r\n           - The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and;\r\n           - accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\r\n\r\n2) A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\r\n\r\n3) An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the RMP program at Altamont helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at El Paso.  In fact, Altamont has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance"

      "SummaryText": "and injuries and damage to its employees, the public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nAltamont limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at Altamont, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect El Paso workers, the public, and the environment and Altamont takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nAltamont prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at Altamont, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAltamont limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Altamont trains workers to respond to an emergency response, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, Altamont works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to limit injuries and environmental damage if a release does occur.\r\n\r\nThe safety program at Altamont consists of a number of elements, many of which are required by the RMP rule.  These are the same elements defined under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule, which are required for this facility.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Altamont that are required by the RMP rule."
