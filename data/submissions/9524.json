The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is 30,000 pounds. The refrigeration system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. \n\nThe facility also operates a chlorinator induction system utilizing one ton containers of chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5) connected to the system. This chlorinator system has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine and is therefore subject to the OSHA and EPA compliance programs.

In 40 CFR 68.22 the requirements are spelled out for the dispersion modeling of the worst case and alternative scenarios. The toxic end points (EPRG-2) are required as the level set by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). This is \"the maximum airborne concentration in which it is believed that almost all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious irreversible health effects or other symptoms that could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.\" \n    40CFR 68 also requires that all worst case air dispersion models use the prescribed wind speed and atmospheric stability class, the largest expected storage vessel (or the largest expected pipe or container; which ever has the greatest off-site impact), ambient humidity/temperature, and that a ground level release event is modeled.
