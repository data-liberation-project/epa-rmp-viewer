      "SummaryText": "The Nemaha County Cooperative Association is dedicated to the safety of it's employees, patrons and the communities that we operate in. To demonstrate our dedication to safety we continually hold safety meetings for our personnel, actively work with our county fire departments and have hired an expert on anhydrous ammonia safety to assist us with our safety programs.The Nemaha County Co-op, Centraila Ks facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.38.}  The Nemaha County Co-op has provided to Kansas Department of Environmental Quality and the Nemaha County local emergency planning committee the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III {EPCRA}.  The Nemaha County Co-op has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.120}, including a memorandum of understanding with the Nemaha Rual Fire Department for response to our facility.  Additionally, the Nemaha County Co-op has trained our employees {and local fire department} in accordance with OSHA's Hazwoper Rules.                                                                                                                                                     \n\nThe distance to endpoint for a worst case scenario is 1.1 miles using EPA's number on a 1,000 gallon nurse tank filled to 85% capacity. The distance to endpoint for an alternative release is .47 miles using a one inch hose break according to the Degadis modeling that TFI provided for the ammonia industry. In either of these cases there are public receptors including homes, a school , park and nursing home that would be affected. \nIt should also be noted that these nurse tanks are not left at Centrailia year-around. Only during ammonia season do we keep nurse tanks at this location. There is no storage plant at Centrailia however we did include 10 nurse tanks totaling 43,000 pounds for our total quanity stored at this location."
