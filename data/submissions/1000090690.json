Five-year Accident History.\r\nRBC is a newly constructed facility.  As such, there are no incidents to report for five-year accident history.\r\n\r\n5.  Emergency Response Program.\r\nThe RBC facility has a written emergency plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan addresses evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, and communication to the public. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. To ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the processes that would require a modified emergency response. The emergency plan has been reviewed with the Herrick Township Fire Department, the local emergency response commission, and local law enforcement.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\r\nNiche personnel maintain and  improve safety at the facility through training, process knowledge, safe job procedures, periodic compliance audits, and encouragement of employee awareness and communication of unsafe practices or near misses.  Changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures undergo a management of change process to identify and address safety considerations prior to implementing a facility change."

      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\r\nREV LNG SSL BC (REV Bradford County, henceforth, RBC), an entity wholly owned by Niche LNG, LLC (Niche), is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is Niche's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a minor release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  However, in the case of a catastrophic release, as a non-responding facility, personnel are advised to evacuate and call 911 to obtain additional resources from Herrick Township and Bradford County such as local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.  Additionally, Niche has contracted Elk Environmental Services as an emergency response organization to provide additional emergency response and remediation expertise.\r\n\r\n2.
