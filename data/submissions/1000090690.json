Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nREV LNG SSL BC (REV Bradford County, henceforth, RBC), an entity wholly owned by Niche LNG, LLC (Niche), is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is Niche's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a minor release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  However, in the case of a catastrophic release, as a non-responding facility, personnel are advised to evacuate and call 911 to obtain additional resources from Herrick Township and Bradford County such as local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.  Additionally, Niche has contracted Elk Environmental Services as an emergency response organization to provide additional emergency response and remediation expertise.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nRBC consists of an incoming gas metering and regulation skid, gas pretreatment system, liquefaction system, process coolers, bulk liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tanks, tractor refueling, and product trailer loading. The facility includes a motor control center building, operations control room, and natural gas-fired power generators to produce onsite electricity for the entire plant. \n\n \n\nRBC produces a nameplate capacity of 50,000 gallons of LNG per day, stored in three 60,000 gallon storage tanks, for a total storage of 180,000 gallons. LNG is loaded into trailers for distribution to customers. \n\n \n\nLNG produced and contained on site by RBC consists of greater than 95% methane and exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) for applicability under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's"
