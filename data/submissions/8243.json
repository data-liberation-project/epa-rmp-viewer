The facility policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Webb Ag, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintance and training of all personall that work with that amterial. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2.  Facility Information: a primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia to be used in the field application method.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario would be a release of the total contents of the largest anhydrous tank labeled N1 released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity releaseed would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by designs standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .84 miles.\n\n\nThe alternate case release scenario would be a release of the the total contents of the second largest anhydrous tank labeled S1 released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 37,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by designs standard and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .73 miles.\n\n4.  The  accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of agriculture are consistent with ANSIK61.1 and OHSA 29 CFR 191 0.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhyd"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency acrtion plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for the coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned changes to imnprove safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going program at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operaions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
