If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nA.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThis facility strives to exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations.  Training is provided for each employee upon initial hire and annually thereafter.  The anhydrous ammonia process is inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. \r\n\r\nB.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 128,010 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nC.\tWorst-case release scenario and the Alternative release scenario\r\n\r\nA.\tThe worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 128,010 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\r\nB.\tThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 14.71 minute release from a break in a 1 inch transfer hose."
