We recieve flammable gas as a propane mixture by tank truck. Our largest tank has a 6800\ngallon capacity. Our policy is not to fill any tank more than 85% full.  We also receive flammable liquids by tank trucks. Our entire property is enclosed with a fence. We have an approved Cal Osha Pressure Vessel Division unloading manifolds. We have permits for all our gas tanks, which are issued by this same agency. All tanks, pumps, piping, fittings, and valves are installed and maintained following NFPA-58 requirements, and maintained under national  LP Gas Association guide lines. All installations have been approved by the local fire department. The fire department does a walk through the entire facilty every so often. This will prepare them in the event of any necessary emergency response. The fire station is less than a half mile away. \n      We have procedures for unloading chemicals and gasses. All chemicals are stored in diked containment areas. These containment areas have manual drain valves. All valves on the tanks containing flammable gasses are closed when not in use. We have a preventative maintainance program that insures that our tanks and handling equipment remain in safe working condition. Shield employees are well trained to do thier particular job tasks. \n      We hold periodic fire and emergency drills. An evacuation route has been posted. In the event of an emergency, certain employees have pre-assigned duties. Once the evacuation alarm is sounded, all other employees will remain in the designated evacuation area until instructed to return to thier work stations by the plant manager. If a discharge cannot be controlled, or in the event of a fire, the fire department will be summoned immediately and all other required agencys will be notified. If neccessary, we have made arrangements with an outside contractor to help us with a release.  "

These tanks are equipped with an excess flow valve and pressure relief valve. We have maintenance procedures that will prevent corrosion. This policy limits our inventory to 85% of the tank capacity. Our alternative release scenario would be a one inch pipe break, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.\n     We have excess flow and check valves in line, as well as manual and automatic shut off valves. No accidental releases have occured at our facility. No immediate plan changes are necessary at this time to improve safety. \n      Our policy is that in the event of either of these scenarios taking place, we would not attempt to control the situation. The local fire department has been informed that they would be summoned immediately as a first responder."
