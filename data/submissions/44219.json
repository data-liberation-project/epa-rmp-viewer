The facility has developed and maintains accident preventiohn programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.\n\n2.  Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Wymore Water Treatment Plant is located adjacent to a residential area at 925 Wymore Road, in Winter Park, Orange County, Florida.  Winter Park uses chlorine as a disinfectant in a water treatment process.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to five one-ton containers at the chlorination process building.  Two one ton containers are always connected to the process, while up to three additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 10,000 pounds.  This is greater than the 2,500 pound RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is not enclosed in a building, but is sheltered from direct sun by a roof.\n\n\n4.  Prevention Program\n\nAs a public facility, the Wymore Water Treatment Plant is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Wymore Water Treatment Plant chlorination process in the Program 2 level. The Wymore Water Treatment facility address all  elements for the Prevention Program 2 as required by the RMP rule.  The Prevention Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The Prevention Program also includes a preventative mainteannce plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good "

Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, have been required by the City of Winter Park.  These procedures ensure that non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review equipment information and the development of Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams.  These actions ensure that the equipment meets  chlorination and wastewater industry standards and that accurate equipment information is available when needed.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5.  Accident History\n\nThe Wymore Water Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past 5 years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Wymore Water Treatment Plant  has an Emergency Rsponse Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has a prcedure for addressing small releases of chlorine.  The current plan has been coordinated with th Winter Park and Orange County Fire Department and the District 6 Local Emergency Planning Committee.
