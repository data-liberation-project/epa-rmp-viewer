If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\nFacility Information\n\n\u00bfThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer for retail sale to farmers.\n\n\u00bfAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n\u00bfThe maximum quantity stored would be 132,600 lbs in a 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 130,000 pounds.\n\n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\n\u00bfThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\u00bfThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\u00bfHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\u00bfThe facility has:\n\n\u00bfA written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CF"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions and training of employees.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
