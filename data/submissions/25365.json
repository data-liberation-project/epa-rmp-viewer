The ESD system requires that a representative access the site, determine alarm reason and clear the alarm reason before restarting the load rack.",

      "SummaryText": "The Plattsburg Terminal is located in a rural area north of the town of Plattsburg, Missouri, adjoing Missouri Highway 33.  The facility receives propane from a Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LPG pipeline, stores the product, and loads it onto trucks.  The facility was constructed and placed into service in March 2002.  Three (3) 90,000-gallon storage tanks provide storage capacity.  The propane loading equipment includes paired loading pumps, a mercaptan odorant injection system for truck loading, and a loading rack with room for two trucks to load simultaneously.   Each loading spot contains paired loading arms for truck loading with an Accuload III control system which controls the loading operation, including odorant injection.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored as an odorant to be injected as transport trucks are loaded.  Methanol is kept in storage for injection into the propane when moisture is detected.  Utilities include remote computer control with UPS backup, instrument air, electric power management and a vent system.  \n\nThe facility is normally unmanned during the day, Monday through Sunday, with safety-systems-trained transport drivers provided 24 hour access via a computer-based entry and product loading control system.  As a normally unoccupied remote facility, there is no assigned operator at the terminal, but a local company representative is available for callout.  Terminal operations can be monitored remotely via computer modem by the local representative or by the Houston-based home office.  Either location can initiate an emergency shutdown (ESD) procedure, if the situation requires.  The loading skid contains many active and passive safety systems to ensure the terminal is shutdown should conditions dictate.  On-site response to any terminal ESD is required before normal operations can resume."
