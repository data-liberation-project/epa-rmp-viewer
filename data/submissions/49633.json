The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC. to notify the Boardman Rural Fire Protection District, Morrow County Sheriff Department, and Morrow County Emergency Management and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process co-product known as wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum aqueous ammonia stored will be approximately 90,000 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be"

      "SummaryText": "approximately 840,000 pounds (total pentane approximately 336,000 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC. has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC. has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough the completion of this RMP, Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC. has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC. is a new facility and does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility anticipates start up of operations the week of August 27, 2007."
