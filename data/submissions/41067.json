To ensure the safe operation of our process, SSI has complied with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Title 29 Code of Federal Regulation(CFR) 1910.119, EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP) Title 40 CFR Part 68, and ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems. \nThe plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1) To save lives.\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3) To protect the environment.\n4) To minimize property damage.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, programs have been developed to prevent the occurence of a release and or minimize the consequences of a significant release of anhydrous ammonia, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Programs developed for the PSM/RM plan include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractor qualifications, and incident investigation.  To help coordinate the plan, a management program has been established as well as an internal audit program which will help identify compliance status and possible deficiencies in the program.  In the event of a toxic release , an emergency responce plan coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), rural fiire department and trained company personnel has been written.  The ultimate goal for SSI's PSM/RM plan is to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illness and avoid physical damage to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they focus on the rules, procedures, and guidelines which govern the industry.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE "

A seperate (new) ammonia refrigeration system was installed on the SSI premisis in 2002 to accommodate the Plant 3 addition. The new system inventory is approximatlely 8000 lbs. which increases the maximum onsite inventory to 68,000 lbs. of ammonia. \n\nThe accidental release prevention program in general starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping and valves are inspected on a regular schedual depending on manufacture and industry recommendations, for example; all compressors are inspected on a monthly basis for oil leaks, pressure and temperature guage calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motor and compressor, filter change, vibrating readings and sensor calibrations are performed every 6 months;  the condensor 24 point air purger system is inspected weekly,  this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers,  motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  low and intermediate pressure reciever oil pots are drained, pump pressure is recorded and pumps and valves are defrosted for excessive ice build up weekly;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating limit conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, material deformity daily;  pressure relief valves are replaced on a five year preventative maintenance schedual (7/2003) or when one has been activated.  An ammonia sensor system is in the compressor engine room as well as a seperate detection system strategicly located in occupied areas. A new ammonia sensor safety system is to be installed by June of 2005 as per our 2002 audit recommendation. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE   \n\nThe facility's emergency response plan is based on OSHA requirements for Emergency Acti"

The Emergency Response Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility. Onsite personnel have been trained and are quilified to respond aggressively to isolate and control a release.  Equipment such as self contained breathing apparatus, respirators, serivex body suits, encapsolated level A suits, gloves, boots and personal monitors are available for the emergency response team (ERT).\n\nSSI coordinates emergency response efforts with the local fire department(s) and the area Hazmat Response Team as responding agencies scheduling permits.\n\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years there have been no reportable releases.\n\nContinued improvements for the ammonia refrigeration process is a top priority for SSI Food Services LLC.  The management plan, internal audits, Process Hazard Analysis, as well as our prevention programs will be monitored and updated as neccessary to ensure that all elements for the PSM/RM plan is complete."
