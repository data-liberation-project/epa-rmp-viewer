Refrigeration capacity is provided from a central engine room and refrigerant is transported to various freezing and cooling systems located throughout the facility via a piping system. An evaluation was performed using a \u00bfwhat-if\u00bf hazard evaluation criteria as set forth in the guidelines for Chemical Hazard Evaluation Procedures prepared by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. This method was used to identify the potential hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, and the likely consequence of those hazards when an accidental release event is experienced, including those due to earthquake equipment failure, operator error, design deficiencies, and maintenance. The facility is operated by refrigeration engineers and technicians association (RETA) certified refrigeration operators and the equipment is in good condition and maintained to establish maintenance standards. In addition, various controls are utilized to maintain equipment at proper operating ranges and to automatically provide shut down in the event that equipment begins to operate out of the designed safe range. All equipment utilized in the refrigeration system is treated for the use of ammonia refrigerant.  Storage and operating vessels are ASME rated and employ emergency pressure relief valves required by code for vessel protection. Due to the many safety features of the facility, including documented operating procedures, ammonia releases other than small leaks are considered unlikely. Our controls were put in real life test on July 31, 2003 when our plant experienced an ammonia leak, our controls in place and training given to responding personnel resulted in no injuries or off-site consequences. Since that time additional safety measures have been implemented to further mitigate. VersaCold currently has several operating and main"

The programs include the operating and maintenance of equipment by RETA certified operators 24 hour / 7 day per week basis. Other risk reducing measures include seismic piping, equipment restraints, by-pass detectors throughout the facility that are linked to emergency shut-off valves should ammonia vapors be detected. Anhydrous ammonia is the only acutely hazardous material used at the facility. The current system charge is 25,000 pounds."
