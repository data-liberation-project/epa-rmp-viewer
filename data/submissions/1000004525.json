      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries facility chills and stores a variety of food products in the cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  The process is similar to a household refrigerator in that it is a closed system with no expected emissions or leaks.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 21,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n-IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n\n-IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n-IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n-IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Re"

This program is constantly being improved to more accurately describe the prevention programs in use at the facility.\n\n\n\nBuilding Codes:\n\n\n\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.  Special attention is directed to but not limited to:\n\n\n\n-ANSI/ASHRAE 15-1989 - Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\n-ANSI/IIAR 2-1984 - Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems\n\n-ANSI BB31.5-1983 - Refrigeration Piping\n\n-ASME - Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX\n\n-UMC - Uniform Mechanical Code\n\n-UFC - Uniform Fire Code\n\n-NFPA - Fire Protection\n\n-UBC - Uniform Building Code, 1991, Seismic Zone 3\n\n\n\nEngineering Measures:\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system uses a computer system to bring equipment on-line, off-line, control the hot gas (compressor discharge) defrosting process, manipulate solenoid valves, and monitor the system for alarms.  Ammonia sensors are used throughout the facility and are connected to the computer system.  The high pressure receiver has a solenoid actuated king valve that is closed when any of the emergency shutdown buttons are activated.\n\n\n\nThere are two remote emergency shut off buttons at the Super Store Industries facility; one at the back door of the machine room and one in the hallway near the control room.  In the event that one of these switches is activated, all refrigeration system equipment will be shutdown.  This includes the compressors, ammonia pumps, defrost hot gas regulators, and King Solenoid Valve.  The programmable controller will however, continue to read all the system sensors.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nA review into the facility's accident history revealed that there have bee"

      "SummaryText": "n no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (May 2004 to May 2009) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.  However, the facility had a \"near miss\" involving a valve that had malfunctioned.  On October 22, 2007, the Chief Refrigeration Technician was notified of an ammonia leak in the Freezer Shipping Dock (Zone 7) via the Control System.  The Chief Refrigeration Technician went into the Freezer Shipping Dock to verify the leak, but he could not smell any ammonia.  The Chief Refrigeration Technician and another operator went on the roof and discovered a liquid ammonia leak from a valve that had malfunctioned.  Emergency response procedures were initiated, and the valve was reseated and sealed properly.  An investigation into the incident revealed that approximately 2 gallons of ammonia was released from the system as a result of a valve that did not seat properly when piping in Zone 7 was replaced.  San Joaquin County OES was notified of the leak.  There were no injuries resulting from this incident.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries has an in-house Emergency Response Team that is trained to handle an ammonia release.  All refrigeration operators are OSHA Technician Level trained (24 hours) and all supervisors are OSHA First Responder Operations Level trained (8 hours).  The Super Store Industries' \"Emergency Response Plan\", is designed to meet the requirements for \"Process Safety Management\", and give our employees and community the maximum protection in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe contents of this plan are used in the Hazardous Materials Management Plan which is filed with the San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department, as well as to update the existing plan in the Training Program Manual. The process for developing the best possible mitigation to any release large or small is through employee"

      "SummaryText": " participation using the \"Process Safety Management Committee\", and any site specific documented plan previously used. \n\n\n\nThe \"Response Plan\", includes continuously changing scenarios that are discussed during those meetings to always improve Response Safety. An \"Emergency Response Team\", located at this facility as well as \"First Responders Operational Program\" gives Super Store Industries both defensive and offensive protection.\n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries conducts on-site emergency drills to provide training and to evaluate employee response in the event of a potential release. Fire drills can be incorporated using the scenarios that the wind may have disrupted the designated area on occasion.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation conducted on May 5-6, 2009, and the Three-Year Compliance Audit conducted on January 29, 2009, provided mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Super Store Industries facility located at 16888 McKinley Avenue in Lathrop, California 95330.  In addition to the recommendations, the facility plans to have all refrigeration operators review training videos provided by the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) in an overall effort to maintain awareness with respect to the hazards associated with operating an ammonia refrigeration system. All refrigeration operators are members of the local RETA organization and participate regularly in the monthly meetings, which furthers their education.\n\n"
