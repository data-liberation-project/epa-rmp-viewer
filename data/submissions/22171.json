      "SummaryText": "Platte Chemical Company is a toll manufacturer of liquid and dry formulations of crop protection chemicals. The company is a part of United Agriproducts, a wholly owned subsidiary of ConAgra. Platte Chemical Company operates three facilities in the United States, one of which is located in Greenville, MS. The Greenville, MS facility formulates and packages emulsifiable concentrates, dry flowables, liquid suspension concentrates, pellets, and wettable powders. These formulations include insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides.\n\nUp until December of 2000, none of the products that the Greenville, MS facility handled required compliance to EPA's risk management program rule. During the summer of 2000; however, Platte-Greenville began construction of a new formulation and packaging plant for liquid herbicides. The construction of this plant resulted in the addition of approximately 15 new employees. As a part of the operation of this new plant, Platte-Greenville will begin to handle sufficient quantities of isopropylamine to require compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program Rule.\n\nThe Platte-Greenville facility has a documented emergency response plan which includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events, including fire, releases, and inclement weather. The plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as notification to the surrounding community. A copy of the plan has been given to and communicated to the Washington County Emergency Planning Committee and the Greenville Fire Department. In case of an accidental release, Platte-Greenville's employees are trained on shutdown procedures and evacuation. No employee is expected to endanger themselves in responding to accidents.\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there has been no RMP defined accidental releases at the Platte-Greenville location. Platte has included in the RMP one flammable worst case scenario and one flammable alternative. These sc"

      "SummaryText": "enarios are based on information gathered from suppliers of isopropylamine as well as information from other sites that handle isopropylamine. The worst case scenario assumes the entire contents of the isopropylamine storage tank is discharged and results in a pool fire. This event, due to the design of the tank, is highly unlikely. A more likely alternative scenario includes rupture of a line containing isopropylamine. In this alternative, area sensors would automatically shut down all valves and pumps.\n\nPlatte-Greenville employs all of the techniques for a comprehensive prevention and response program including process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity, operating procedures, management of change, contractor and visitor program, employee training and participation programs.\nIf you have questions about this RMP, please contact us at 662-335-3395."
