The health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities and prevention of pollution are among Sealed Air's primary concerns. Sealed Air is committed to providing safe working conditions for our employees, to promoting the safe design, use and handling of Sealed Air products and to complying with laws relating to the protection of the environment. Each employee is expected to promote these goals in his or her tasks. We also work toward safety and environmental excellence as an integral part of our World Class Manufacturing program. \r\n\r\nEach Division General Manager has ultimate responsibility for the administration of EHS programs and regulatory compliance; however, compliance with this Policy is the responsibility of every Sealed Air employee.\r\n\r\nThe plant has a multi-faceted safety programs that support public health, safety and environmental issues. These programs include employee education and training combined with physical prevention. One of the cornerstone programs for flammable materials is the Process Safety Management program.\r\n\r\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled \r\n\r\nOverview of Process\r\n\r\nThe Sealed Air Corporation Hudson facility manufactures polyethylene foam products used as packaging or recreational material. The foam is polyethylene material with bubbles encased within sheets, or blocks. These bubbles within the foam are called cells.\r\n\r\nPolyethylene foam sheets, planks, rounds, etc. are produced using an extruder. The extruder performs three d"

The blowing agent is pumped into the extruder under pressure. Once the polyethylene / blowing agent mixture leaves the die, and the mixture is no longer under pressure, the blowing agent vaporizes and begins to expand the material into foam. \r\n\r\n\r\nOverview of Blowing Agent System\r\n\r\nThe blowing agent is stored in approved pressure vessel as non-odorized liquid petroleum under pressure (under 150 psi). The liquid is pumped at low pressure to the plant's high pressure pumps.  A metering station regulates and controls the flow of the blowing agent into the injection port of the extruder. \r\n\r\nThe facility has one blowing agent tank rated for 250 psi (18,000-gallons).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA flammable worst case scenario assumes a hydrocarbon vapor cloud explosion using EPA's RMP guidance for hydrocarbon storage facilities reference tables or equations. The calculated endpoint distance with the release of the full storage vessel (67,000 lbs.) with a 1-PSI endpoint is 0.3 miles. The estimated residential population within the distance to endpoint is 222 people.  In addition to the residential population, there are several industrial buildings which would fall within the blast area which have a maximum employee population of 162 people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe likelihood of a vapor cloud explosion with a full storage vessel release is possible but highly unlikely. The more possible scenario would be the leak of the piping to or from the storage vessels. As an alternate scenario, we have considered the repute of a pipe with a release rate of 10 pounds per minute for 10 minutes creating a vapor cloud explosion. The estimated distance to"

The consequence would most likely not exceed the property lines of Sealed Air. \r\n\r\nThe environmental, health and safety programs that are used at this facility make the chances for a reportable material release very remote.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe plant has a multi-faceted safety program that supports health, safety, and environmental issues. One of the more in-depth programs is Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals that was promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor (29 CFR 1910.119). The purpose of this requirement is to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. \r\n \r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps include mitigation, prevention and abatement procedures. These include: \r\n\r\nA. Employee education and training:\r\na) All employees receive initial and yearly refresher training in our Hazardous Commutation program, and spill and emergency spill response plans.\r\nb) The production and maintenance personnel are trained to operate the blowing agent systems under safety procedures outlined in the plant's Process Safety Management program.\r\n\r\nB. Physical Prevention:\r\na) A process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) of the equipment and process was performed for the facility in February 2003. \r\nb) A Management of Change procedure is used to assure that only authorized changes are made to the process. \r\nc) Incident investigation procedures are followed to address areas of concern.\r\nd) An Emergency Action Plan is used to document and train employees to handle non-routine situations. \r\ne) Daily inventory reconciliation of the blowing agent tanks are conducted.\r\nf) Maintenance personnel physically inspect the blowing agent systems each shift (3-tim"

An accidental release is a spill of 500 pounds or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program\r\n\r\nSealed Air Corporations Hudson, North Carolina facility has in place numerous safety programs and safety systems to mitigate the consequence of any reasonable release scenario.  Of those programs, an active employee and management safety committee is an ongoing program of constant improvement, in how we deal on a daily basis with both chemical and work place hazards.  Systems in place to reduce the likelihood of a release of regulated substances include both electronic monitoring and mechanical devices which will reduce the risk of a release.  In addition to the aforementioned devices this facility is regulated under the OSHA process safety management which gives a system of checks and balances to monitor the risk.  In the event of a release it is the policy of Sealed Air to immediately notify the local fire department and all appropriate governmental agencies. Sealed Air conducts annual training with the local fire department and will additionally provide the Schenectady County Local Emergency Planning Committee with all information related to the risk management program.\r\n\r\n\r\n Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nSealed Air has very robust environmental, health and safety programs that are driven by active employee participation.
