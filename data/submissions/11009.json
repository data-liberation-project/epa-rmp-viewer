(AGA) facility located in Hammond, Indiana complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane, propylene or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Hammond Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe AGA facility manufactures acetylene and stores propane and propylene in above ground storage tanks (ASTs).  All three gases are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane storage/handling process consists of one 30,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The propylene storage/handling process consists of one 2,600-gallon propylene AST, propylene cylinder filling equipment, filled propylene cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a medium pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\nThe worst-case release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential failure of one 30,000-gallon storage tank filled to 80% of it's holding capacity (administrative controls limit each storage tank to 80% of capacity at 600F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities, a city wildlife preserve and residential property.  The residential population within this 0.4-mile radius is approximately 1400 persons, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report. \n\n4.  The alternative release scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential release of propane from a 100-pound capacity storage cylinder (i.e., caused by a cylinder being knocked over, resulting in the cylinder valve being broken off), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The release rate of propane from the cylinder was estimated to be 1.67 pounds per minute.  It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 60 minutes.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 100 pounds of propane.  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the flammable endpoint was determined to be 0.02 miles.  The only affected public receptor under this alternative release scenario is a commercial facility.  There is no residential population within this 0.02-mile radius.\n\n5.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe AGA facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The propane, propylene, and acetylene systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the AGA facility in Hammond, Indiana.\n\n6.

The emergency response program:\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our propane storage system, it is AGA's policy to immediately notify the Hammond Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Hammond Fire Department.  All employees have access to AGA's emergency action plan, and emergency action training is conducted annually.  \n\n8.
