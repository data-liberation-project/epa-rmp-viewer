      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSargent Canyon Cogeneration Company stores and utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process and in a thermal energy storage (TES) system at their facility in the San Ardo oil fields near Paso Robles, California.  It is Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company?s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company?s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nSargent Canyon Cogeneration Company emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nSargent Canyon Cogeneration Company is independently audited to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three years, Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nTexaco San Ardo Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texaco Producing Inc., formed a general partnership with the Anacapa Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy Company, for the development of the cogeneration plant.  The partnership, named Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company, owns and operates the facility.  The plant began commercial operation in October, 1991.  \n\nThe Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company facility is located in Section 13, T32S/R10E, MDB&M in "

      "SummaryText": "the sparsely populated San Ardo oil fields.\n\nCogeneration, in the case of the Sargent Canyon project, is the simultaneous production of thermal energy and electrical energy from the combustion of a single fuel source.  Combustion of the fuel takes place in a gas turbine that is physically coupled to an electric generator.  Waste heat from the gas turbine?s exhaust flows into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  The HRSG extracts the heat from the exhaust gases and produces steam for thermally enhanced oil recovery.  Electricity is produced at the same time via the electric generator coupled to the combustion turbine.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company facility to create a reducing atmosphere in the SCR process.  This reducing atmosphere in the flue gas helps convert nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water as it passes through the catalytic reactor.  The operation of the SCR system substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen oxides from the gas turbine.\n\nLiquid ammonia is stored in a 15,000 gallon (water capacity) storage tank.  The maximum intended inventory of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank is based on the American National Standard Institute?s K61.1 safety requirements and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations published in Section 1910.111 of 29 CFR (and Section 509 of Title 8, CCR).  These standards and regulations limit the maximum ammonia storage capacity of the tank to approximately 69,960 pounds.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is also utilized as a refrigerant in the TES system to cool the inlet air for the gas turbine during warm weather.  The TES system includes an ammonia  refrigeration system that generates ice during off-peak hours.  The ice is stockpiled in an ice storage tank.  During on-peak hours, chilled water is circulated from the ice storage tank to the inlet to the gas turbine.  At the inlet of the gas turbine, the chilled water flows through a heat exchanger which cools the inlet "

Cooling the inlet combustion air of the gas turbine improves the turbine?s power output during warm on-peak hours.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system consists of a low pressure receiver, a high pressure pilot receiver, an evaporator, a compressor, two condensers, and an oil separator reservoir.  The largest vessel in the system is the low pressure receiver which contains approximately 3200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n?Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n?An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and has been updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n?Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n?Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n?Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n?Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n?A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n?Pre-startup safety reviews are performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is signifi"

The Executive Director has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nSargent Canyon Cogeneration Company has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based SCR and TES systems that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSargent Canyon Cogeneration Company has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Sargent Canyon Cogeneration Company regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.
