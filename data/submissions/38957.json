The regulated substance uner RMP ruling is Anhydrous Ammonia that is used in the refrigeration system. This is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario release to toxic endpoint was determined using the RMP Comp guidance for Anhydrous Ammonia. The scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nVessel:                           High Pressure Receiver\nAmount released:             7350 lbs.\nDuration of Release:        10 minutes\nRelease Rate:                 735 lbs/min\nWind Speed:                  1.5 meters/sec\nAtmospheric Stability:     F\nTopography:                   Urban\n\nBased on the RMP Comp the toxic endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.40 miles.\n\nAlternative Worst Case Scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario was determined using the RMP Comp guidance for Anhydrous Ammonia. The scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nScenario:                       Relief valve failure on the HPR\nOrifice Size:                   1/2\"\nRelease Rate:                360 lbs/min.\nDuration of Release:       10 minutes\nAmount Released:          3600 lbs.\nWind Speed:                  1.5 meters/sec\nAtmospheric Stability:    F\nTopography:                  Urban\n\nBased on the RMP Comp guidance the toxic endpoint is 0.20 miles.\n\nOberlin Farms is implementing the Process Safety Management program at this facility to align their ammonia system to a better operation. In implementing PSM, Oberlin Farms has established written operating proceduresand written maintenance procedures to maintain the ammonia system. Also, Oberlin Farms is outlining a program for the employees from awareness through hazmat responder and trained refrigeration operators. Oberlin Farms is very dedicated to aligning their operation of the ammonia system to meet all "
