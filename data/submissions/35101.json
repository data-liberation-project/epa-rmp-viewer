Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThrough a team approach, using training, and cooperation, Otis Spunkmeyer, Cayce, South Carolina, facility, maintains a continued preparedness to keep in compliance with: The Occupational Safety and Health Act rEGULATions of the Environmental Protection Agency tHe environmental policies and principles of the Otis Spunkmeyer, Inc.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAS risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The purpose of the accidental relase prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Otis Spunkmeyer, Cayce, South Carolina, facility produces muffins and other related bakery items.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 10,970 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program.The closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (3) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation and processing of perishable food products.  Through the use of sin"

Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Plan. This emergency plan deals with: Accidental spills, leaks or discharges of hazardous substances into the environment. Measures to be taken to prevent an accident. Countermeasures to be taken in the event of an emergency. Procedures for containing and limiting the duration of the emergency, Measures to be taken for further protection of employees responding to the emergency, as well as, other plant personnel. Procedures for proper cleanup and proper handling of hazardous waste.All members of the Cayce Plant emergency response team attended initial training in HAZMAT emergency response of 32 hours.  After this training, each member will attend an 8-24 hour refresher annually. In addition to classroom training, the course includes simulated field exercises using complete HAZMAT response personal protective equipment, in which all members participate. Comprehensive testing is administered to a"
