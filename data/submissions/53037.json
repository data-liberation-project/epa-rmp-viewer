Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSeadrift Operations of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The information from the Risk Management Plan has been shared with plant neighbors, LEPC members, elected officials, and other community members through public meetings.  Input on the plan has been received from the Community Advisory Panel and has been incorporated into the plan as well as the public communication sessions.\n\n2.Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nUnion Carbide Seadrift Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces approximately 2.4 billion pounds of plastic, rubber, and other chemical products in its various operating plants.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide and Dow processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Seadrift Site, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and/or flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.\n\n Union Carbide Seadrift  Operations has the following RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances in quantities above"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, appear in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario --\n\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 294,000 pounds of ethylene oxide as a gas to the atmosphere.   An administrative control limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85% (294,000pounds).  According to EPA\u00bfs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public .  The following administrative control is used in this analysis:\n Inventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85 percent (294,000 pounds).\n\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n Double Wall Tank:  The tank has a secondary tank wall which is designed to contain a leak in the primary wall.\nSecondary Wall Leak Detection:  A sensor is designed to detect leaks between the primary and secondary walls of the tank.\n Enclosed Tanks:  The surge tanks are inside concrete containment walls and covered with gravel to minimize the potential for external impact.\nSecondary Containment Around Tanks:  The area around the tanks is di"

The detectors are also tied into an automatic actuation of the deluge system.\nThe propylene trailer is equiped with excess flow check valves to limit the release in the event of a piping or hose failure.\nFire water monitors are located stragically around the tank to assist in fire fighting and suppress vapor emissions. \nMonitoring and Surveillance: The area is inspected frequently as routine part of operations.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA)  General Program\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard and implementation of the Dow Process Risk Management Standard.    Key elements include:\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted at least every five years to identify worst case  scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\nLayers of Protection Analysis:  LOPA's are conducted where the identified hazards warrant it.  The layers that are ident"

This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements.\n\n5.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Union Carbide Seadrift Operations that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n Evacuation and shelter-in-place plans and accounting for personnel after an incident\n Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\n\nThe emerg"
