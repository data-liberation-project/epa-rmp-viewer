THE  BEEF PACKERS, INC., RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Beef Packers, Inc. has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California?s Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA?s ?Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely"

This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Beef Packers, Inc. business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Beef Packers, Inc. facility is a commercial beef slaughter house and processing facility.  The main facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to the Kill Floor area, Offal Storage rooms, Chill Coolers and Boning Rooms. The Kill Floor  is cooled by two packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units. There are four Carcas Coolers and two Offal Storage rooms that are cooled by ceiling mounted fan coil units.  There are five Boning Rooms that are cooled by a combination of three packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units and ceiling mounted fan coil units.  A computer system provides substantia"

From there, low pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve and hand expansion valve and into evaporator  coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators or check valves and is returned to one of  two pumped liquid recirculators located in the engine room.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to a thermosyphon vessel  and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid  from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action. Excess liquid from the liquid recirculators is pumped to a tranfer vessel where the liquid tranfers into the high pressue receiver by gravity.   \n\nThe Kill Floor, Offal rooms, and two Chill Coolers were new facilities built from 1999 to 2001.  The other Chill Coolers the the Boning areas were remodels of an existing meat processing facility.  This work was done from 2001 to 2004.  All areas are served by a new ammonia refrigeration system designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. "

GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Beef Packers, Inc. facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The systems contain a total charge of approximately 30,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures "

      "SummaryText": "and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia through the course of our normal safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nOn July 3, 2001 Beef Packers, Inc. had an accidental release of ammonia at its facility.  The insident happened around 2:00pm.  At this time a pressure relief valve on the roof of the facility releaved due to overpressurization in the associated vessel.  The overpressurization was determine to be the result of operations on the plant water system which affected water pressure leading to an upset in the ammonia refrigeration system.  The duration of the release was estimated at 7 to 10 minutes before the pressure relief valve reseated.  The amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 600lbs. Residents near the Beef Packers, Inc. facility were able to smell the ammonia vapors and were instructed to shelter-in-place until the ammonia passed by and disipated.  Within two hours of the insident the Fire Dept. and the Governer?s Office of Emergency Services were notified.  The G.O.E.S. file number is 01-3831.  As a result of the insident Beef Packers, Inc. determined to modify the refrigeraiton system such that the vessel in question and others like it were removed eliminating the pressure relief valves and the potential for further accidental releases of this nature.\n\n5. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8"

Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment. To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place within the next year. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nAt least once each year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Beef Packers, Inc. continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Beef Packers, Inc. business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.

Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Beef Packers, Inc. now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a ?living document?.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Beef Packers, Inc. employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Beef Packers, Inc. will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
