This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Atlantic Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Temporary Pecos Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Temporary Pecos Gas Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\n\n\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids occurs in the following way.\n\n\n\nNatural gas from nearby wells is gathered into pipes that extend out into the field in a spider web configuration. The pipes are designed so diameters increase as they grow closer into proximity of the compressor facility and volumes are larger. The gas then enters the compressor station.  Pipeline condensate is removed from the gas stream along the pipeline via slug catchers. Removed condensate is routed to pressurized natural gas liquids storage tanks. The produced water is routed to the salt water storage tank.\n\n\n\nThe gas then enters compression. The gas enters a high pressure inlet separator that removes oil and free liquids. The gas then enters one of the TEG Abso"

Each dehydration unit is controlled by a thermal oxidizer. The gas stream flows through a propane refrigeration skid to remove the natural gas liquids. The natural gas liquids are routed to pressurized natural gas liquids storage tanks. The gas stream is regulated. The gas is then measured via an orifice meter and enters transmission pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains three sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; station gas consisting of mostly methane, condensate (pentane) and natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nAtlantic Midstream encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nAtlantic Midstream keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Temporary Pecos Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nAtlantic Midstream has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nAtlantic Midstream primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and Check-List techniques to perform this evaluation.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Temporary Pecos Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nTemporary Pecos Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Temporary Pecos Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Temporary Pecos Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facili"

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nAtlantic Midstream conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nAtlantic Midstream has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
