Since 2016, the Bendix Warehouse serves as a distribution center for its industrial adhesive products. \n\nThe facility is located on a 4.49-acre site and is in an industrial neighborhood on the West side of North Bendix Drive, in the North Western section of the City of South Bend, Indiana.  There is only one occupant and is considered General Warehousing and Storage with the NAICS Code 49311.  \n\nThe 4.49-acre site contains approximately 64,500-square foot building that occupies much of the property.  It operates strictly as a chemical warehouse that receives, stores and ships chemicals used to manufacturer solvent and water-based industrial adhesives and sealants, commercial roofing adhesives, mirror mastics and epoxies as well shipping finished products to customers. Bendix Warehouse does not perform any chemical transfer, repackaging or processing operations. It operates five (5) days a week, with occasional overtime on the weekends, and is closed for US holidays. There are seasonal inventory fluctuations, but the three (3) employees normally work a day shift from 8 AM - 4 PM.\n\nThe warehouse is being used for the storage of DOT Hazard Materials Class 3-Flammable Liquids (sealants and adhesives) which are normally contained in five-gallon sealed pails on unitized pallets.  \n\nAlso, Aerosol cylinders (canisters) containing a DOT Hazardous Materials Class 2.1-Flammable Gas with a NFPA 704-Flammability 4 rating.

Maximum total product weight stored in Aerosol Storage Area #1 is approximately 218,000 lbs.  \n\n \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nBendix Warehouse has an aerosol product stored in small DOT-39 pressurized cylinders containing a chemical mixture of more than 1% pentane and LPG propellant with a NFPA 704-Flammability 4 rating. This aerosol quantity stored in the warehouse is more than the threshold amount listed in 40 CFR 68.130, List of Regulated Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention.  Hence, Bendix Warehouse is required to develop and maintain a management system that identifies the personnel roles or job titles responsible for maintaining each element of the facility's Risk Management Program (RMP) including documentation, communicate changes, and implement any changes for each RMP element. \n\nOSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and Hazard Communication regulatory requirements (29 CFR 1910.119(a)(1)(ii) and 1910.1200(c)) apply since the warehouse is a \"process which involves a listed chemical, pentane, present over threshold reporting values as well as Category 1 flammable gas or a flammable liquid with a flashpoint below 100 ?F (37.8 ?C) stored under pressure on site in one location, in a quantity of 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) or more\".
