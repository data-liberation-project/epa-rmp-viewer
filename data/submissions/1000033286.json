This is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility. It is standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if an incidental release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond. Should an emergency occur, our policy is to notify the Canadian Fire Department and request they respond and plant personnel are prepared to work with the fire department, LEPC and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Antelope Hills gas plant, located near Canadian, Texas, operates processes to extract petroleum products i.e. natural gas liquids (NGL) from field natural gas. NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including the regulated flammables ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes. The NGL product is shipped from the plant by pipeline. There are no threshold quantity of 112 ( r ) regulated toxic substances at this facility. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\n \n\nThe newly constructed gas plant complies with applicable rules and regulations. In the design and construction of the plant and the specification of equipment and its installation, applicable codes and standards issued by ANSI, ASME, ASTM, API, NEMA and NFPA were consulted. \n\n\n\nThe processes that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard. Large quantities of regulated flammab"

There is a training program for employees involved in operating and in maintaining equipment. Refresher training is also provided at required frequencies or more often if needed. Equipment manufacturers recommended maintenance intervals and procedures are used along with replacement parts that satisfy design specifications. \n\n\n\nProcess safety information and reference documents are maintained and readily available to all employees as is specific chemical information. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no offsite accidents within the previous the 5 year time period.  Based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified end point for the worst case scenario is less than the distance to the to the nearest public receptor.   No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Antelope Hills gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan to protect workers, the public's safety as well as the environment. The emergency action plan is tailored to this plant and will be updated as needed and employees informed of and trained in the changes before being implemented.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance, including the possibility of a fire, or explosion, response actions have been coordinated with the Canadian Fire Department and mechanisms for notification are in place, as entry within the distance to the endpoint may pose a danger to public responders, and therefore should not be entered except as arranged with the Energy Transfer emergency contact. \n\n\n\nThe Antelope Hills gas plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate o"
