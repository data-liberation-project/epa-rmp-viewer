      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CARTHAGE GAS PLANT\n\n\n\nMarkWest East Texas Gas Company, L.L.C (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Carthage Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Carthage Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant where it is first dehydrated to remove any water.  The gas is then sent to a turbo-expander where the temperature is reduced. Ethane and heavier liquids are separated from the methane gas stream.  The liquids are then stabilized using a de-methanizer to remove any methane entrained.  The methane is then sent to a sales pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe liquids (ethane and heavier) are processed using an amine unit to remove any carbon dioxide and other acid gases.  The liquids are contacted with the amine where the carbon and acid gases are absorbed by the amine.  The NGLs are then pumped into a product pipeline for sales.\n\n\n\nThe amine enters an amine reboiler where the carbon dioxide and other acid gases are removed from the amine stream.  The carbon dioxide is then vented to the atmosphere. \n\n\n\nThe Product Surge Vessel (V-4) has the capacity to contain 9,055 gallons of natural gas liquids.  The constituents are estimated as 1% Methane, 61% Ethane, 19% Propane, 5% Iso Butane, 5% Butane, 2% Iso Pentane, 2% Pentane, and 4% C6 and higher.  Determination of quantities calculations are available upon request.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case accident sc"

The product surge vessel contains natural gas liquids (NGL)referred to as Y-grade. The release quantity for each regulated substance was modeled using EPA's RMP-COMP and was calculated using a typical NGL composition and density.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario was considered as a process piping release of natural gas.  To be conservative, it was assumed the flow would be unabated for one minute until the hydrocarbon detection system could trigger an emergency shutdown.  At a flow of 194,444 scf/minute, this would cause the release of approximately 194,444 cubic feet of natural gas.  Using the density for methane 0.042 lb/ft? of gas, amounts to a release of 8,220 pounds of methane.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented b"

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.

The operating procedures are centrally located and accessible to all employees.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Carthage Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n\n\nAll MarkWest employees at the Carthage Gas Plant will be trained in PSM/RMP requirement upon hire and prior to working in PSM/RMP processes.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Carthage Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The PSSR confirms that construction was completed in accordance with design specifications, that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.  The PSSR will be reviewed and appropriately updated during the management of change process.  The PSSR will ensure that: modifications were installed as described; no other changes were made outside the original scope of work; operating procedures have been modified and communicated to operating and maintenance personnel; all necessary tests have been completed prior to start-up; all site safety, fire protection, and environmental issues have been addressed; the startup plan has been reviewed; pertinent drawings have been red-lined or updated to as-built requirements; vendor files have been updated; and training of affected personnel has been performed and documented.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, MarkWest periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited.  One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered.  Audits will be conducted using the OSHA Verification Checklist CPL2-2.45a and the EPA Audit Guidance Checklist.  The Plant Compliance Coordinator will maintain"

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nMarkWest promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, determine what error states led to the incident and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident.  The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation.

The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operations. The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the object upon which hot work is to be performed. Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Carthage Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Carthage Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contrac"
