The PHA analyzes scenarios that represent deviations from normal operation, the causes and consequences of these deviations, the safeguards in place to prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous materials, a qualitative assessment of the risk of these scenarios (using a risk matrix for scenario severity and likelihood) and the identification of any recommendations to prevent or mitigate risk; \n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures which include  instructions on handling peracetic acid products,\n\n?    Training - including training for operators handling peracetic acid products, in addition to emergency response training, and OSHA-required safety training, such as hazard communications, personal protective equipment, hearing protection, etc.\n\n?    Incident Investigations and Procedures - which is a list of all incidents or near miss occurrences, the results of investigation into those incidents, and follow-up documentation of corrective actions; \n\n?    Mechanical Integrity/Maintenance program - inspection, testing and preventive maintenance for the equipment and instrumentation utilized in peracetic acid handling\n\n?    Compliance Audits - which documents the findings and corrective actions from internal and external site audits, including insurance company audits.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history - there have been no accidents in the previous five years that meet the RMP requirements for inclusion in the RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nEmergency response - the Stanton site maintains an up-to-date emergency action plan.  The plan details the actions plant employees would take in the event of a release of peracetic acid, incidents involving other substances, fires, and health emergencies.  The plan details the means to notify all workers of incidents and actions to be taken, such as site evacuation and headcount; and includes contact information for local emergency response organizations, including the Stanton Fire Department.
