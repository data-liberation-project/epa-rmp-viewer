THE FACILITY POLICY\r\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF BIRD ISLAND SOIL SERVICE CENTER ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF A ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\r\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF FERTLIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DITECT APPLICATION.  AMHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA WOULD BE 280000 LB IN OUR 30000 GAL STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40000 POUNDS.\r\n\r\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SENARIO.\r\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELASED WOULD BE 140000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.2 MILES.\r\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 2 INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.25 MILES.\r\n\r\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\r\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.AND THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OS"
