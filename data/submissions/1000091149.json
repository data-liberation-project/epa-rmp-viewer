This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nThe East Texas Gas Plant, located 5 miles east of Carthage, Texas on US 79 north, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, & condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The East Texas Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 520 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The East Texas Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years the process has had no accidental release that caused onsite or offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.42.(a)).\n\n\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the East Texas Gas Plant.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the East Texas Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe East Texas Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Initial startup/ Unit startup, (2) Normal operations, (3) Temporary Operations,\n\n(4) Emergency Shutdown, (5) Emergency Operations, (6) Normal Shutdown, and (7) Startup Following a Turnaround or After an Emergency Shutdown.

New employees receive initial training in East Texas Gas Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe East Texas Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
