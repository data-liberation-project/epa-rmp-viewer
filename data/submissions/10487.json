Potter, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n        The owners, management, and employees of Morgan Grain & Feed Co. are comitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n        -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n        -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by the farmer. \n\n        -The maximum quantitiy of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 102,000 pounds in our two-12,000 gallon storage tanks.\n        \n        \n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n         a.  The worst-case release scenario, of Anhydrous Ammonia, would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quatity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.84 miles.\n\n         b.  The alternate release scenario, of Anhydrous Ammonia, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n      \n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n         The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and He"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n              -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n              -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \n               property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n           -The facility has:\n\n           a. to call local emergency responders from outside the firm.\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n           Safety improvement is an on-going process at Morgan Grain & Feed Co.  Periodic evalutations are\n           performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific \n           anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                        Sincerely,\n\n\n                                                                                                        Scott C.
