Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job. It is facility policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with it's Emergency Response Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment, and the general public.\n The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers. The facility complies with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.\n There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n The facility has a written emergency response action plan, provided local authorities the plan and SARA Title III, and includes pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety reccommendations for implementation at this time."
