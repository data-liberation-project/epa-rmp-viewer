THIS RELEASE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 500 AREA RESIDENTS. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A RELEASE OF 11,908 POUNDS OVER A TWO-MINUTE RELEASE PERIOD.  THIS RELEASE WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES AND WOULD AFFECT 500 PEOPLE WITHIHN THE COMMUNITY.\n\nTHIS COMPANY MAINTAINS AND OPERATES THEIR NH3 PLANT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
