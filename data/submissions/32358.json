Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (\u00a7 68.155(a))\n\nOccidental Chemical Corporation has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Niagara Plant.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and the requirements of OSHA `s Process Safety Management Rule, 29CFR 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Niagara Plant.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a7 68.155(b))\n\nThe Niagara Plant handles one regulated substance that is covered by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  This substance is chlorine. \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(d))\n\nThe Niagara Plant\u00bfs prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits,  Incident Investigation, Employee Participation , Key Procedures, Contractors,  and Emergency Preparedness\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and maintained in manuals at the facility.  These manuals are routinely updated.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History (\u00a7 68.155(e))\n There was one"

No offsite impacts or damages. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program (\u00a7 68.155(f))\n\nThe Niagara Plant has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (\u00bfERT\u00bf) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to evaluate the incident Command Structure, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Operations Center (\u00bfEOC\u00bf).  In addition, the Niagara  Plant has developed a Special Situations Plan (\u00bfSSP\u00bf) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe Niagara Plant is a member of Niagara County\u00bfs Local Emergency Planning Committee (\u00bfLEPC\u00bf), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a7 68.155(g))\n\nThe Niagara Plant continuously tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nOriginal on Cover Letter                                               Candace Jaunzemis       \n--------------------------------------------------                          ---------------------------------------------"
