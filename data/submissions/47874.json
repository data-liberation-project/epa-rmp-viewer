The facility manufactures bulk graphite gasket material and processes rayon fabrics and yarns. These products are used for automotive, aerospace and other industrial applications. This facility has been situated at this site since May 1996 and has been engaged in essentially the same operation since that time.\n\nThe facility stores and uses >98% White Fuming Nitric Acid (CAS # 7697372). The system involves a 6000 gallon storage tank, however the nitric acid in the actual production process typically amounts to approximately 2 gallons at any given time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHitco Carbon Composites, Inc. has implemented a unified approach that puts first priority on eliminating accidents and releases through engineering and process changes. Additionally, the system is monitored at all times, specific operating procedures exist for the Nitric Acid System and employees are properly trained.\n\nHitco Carbon Composites, Inc. has a detailed Emergency Action Plan which is specifically designed to respond to accidents or releases involving the Nitric Acid System. Emergency equipment, community notification and employee training are the key elements of this plan.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBased upon the offsite consequences analysis and the requirements of the PSM Program under OSHA (29 CFR 1910.119), the Hitco Carbon Composites, Inc. Risk Management Program is based upon the Level 3 Program requirements of 40 CFR 68. By actively using the following components; 1) Process Hazard Analysis, 2) Operating Procedures, 3) Operator Training, 4) Maintenance, 5) Management of Change, 6) Compliance Audits, 7) Incident Investigations, 8) Employee Participation"

The facility is designed to minimize contact between operators and nitric acid, thereby limiting the effect of operator mistakes. Containment systems and alarms also minimize accidents. All equipment meets or exceeds the industry standards for nitric acid systems. All personnel are trained to safely handle nitric acid and operate the system. The preventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs also minimize the risk of accidents.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nHitco Carbon Composites Inc, while operating as SGL Technics, had one accident involving the Nitric Acid System during the past five years. The accident resulted in an injured employee, however due to the programs implemented by Hitco Carbon Composites, Inc. no off-site consequences were discovered. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA detailed Emergency Response Program is essential in minimizing the impact of an accidental release. Hitco Carbon Composites, Inc. has implemented a thorough action plan that involves training, contingency planning and equipment to allow Hitco employees to respond to any emergency with the nitric acid system."
