Safety and Environmental Managers have been assigned to ensure safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. This site has developed and trained its personnel to an Emergency Evacuation Plan to ensure prompt evacuations during an ammonia emergency. The Plan has specific written evacuation and reporting procedures in place to protect Franzia Winery Sanger employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Franzia Winery Sanger facility covered by this RMP is located at 2916 South Reed Avenue in Sanger, California. The facility produces grape juice that is fermented into wine. The facility uses sulfur dioxide for bacterial control and anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration. \nA stationary anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used for chilling wine. System A at the facility has nineteen chillers and a total of anhydrous ammonia less than 22,000 pounds.\nThe sulfur dioxide system at the facility is located in the center of the winery. Sulfur dioxide is stored in two 1-ton cylinders that supply and fill smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide cylinders ranging from 6- to 100-pound cylinders. The sulfur dioxide is injected from the smaller cylinders into the wine to control the bacteria. This system holds a maximum of 4,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, and to date is exempt from RMP requirements.\n\nNote: The amount of sulfur dioxide onsite (4,000 pounds) is below the threshold amount required by the federal RMP regulation. The Sanger facility has not received formal notification from the Administering Agency (AA) that pursuant to Section 25534 of HSC an RMP is required to satisfy CalARP Program requirements as they pertain to sulfur dioxide, this plan only addresses federal RM"

The plan, kept at the Plant Office, describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release. It details evacuation procedures and response procedures for the mitigation of minor ammonia releases. Usually the Fresno County Fire Department will respond to any non-minor leaks or leaks that cannot be repaired. Employees are trained to this ERP and in the event of a non-minor leak will evacuate and take"

These items where identified in a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) that was conducted December 3, 2004 and have been made a part of this plan.\n\n    RMP Review and Update\n\nThe Franzia Winery Sanger facility will review and update this RMP at least once every 5 years as appropriate.
