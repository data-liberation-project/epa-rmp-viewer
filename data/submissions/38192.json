In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any;  release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviornment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA primary activity of our company is the distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia for crop nutrient input, NAICS code 42491 Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers.  This product is subject to the EPS Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and late fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only, with little if any product transfer taking place. The maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary. The maximum quantity handled at a given time will be  the unloading of a rail tank car or a semi-trailer tank.\n\nThe facility is operated with two full time employees as defined in Section 1.11 of this plan. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected day or night during use, and through out the off season..\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released has been identified earlier in this program and would effect some residential population. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nWe have not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused"
