Treated wastewater is disinfected with chlorine and the treated with sulfur dioxide to remove unreacted chlorine before final discharge to the Elm Fork Trinity River. The facility maintains a maximum inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide above the threshold quantity established by the Environmental Protection Agency is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequences of a potential accidental release of chlorine at the Water Reclamation Plant were assessed in accordance with requirements established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68.  The Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, which provides guidance for chlorine systems and sulfur dioxide systems such as those at the WWTP, was used to model a worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenarios.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is a model of a release under specific conditions established by EPA, including release volume, duration, and weather conditions. Active safety systems in place at the WWTP designed to minimize the effects of a chemical release cannot be considered in the worst case release scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario requires the assumption of a release in a ten minute period of the entire contents of the largest vessel of the regulated chemical onsite that would reach the farthest distance to the toxic endpoint offsite.  For the WWTP, a one-ton sulfur dioxide container is the worst case chemical release.  Meteorological conditions required by EPA rules are assumed for the release.  The toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is estimated to reach a point beyond the boundary of the facility. The worst case release scenario estimates that the vapor would reach a toxic endpoint offsite of the facility pr"

No sensitive environmental receptors are located within the release area.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario represents the results more likely to occur in the event of a chemical release at the WWTP.  Active safety systems at the WWTP are considered for the alternative case release scenario. Average weather conditions at the facility are used for this release scenario, as recommended by EPA regulations. An alternative case release scenario was conducted for chlorine and for sulfur dioxide releases.\n\nFailure of a pipe in the chlorine feed system is assumed for the chlorine alternative case release scenario.  The toxic endpoint for the chlorine alternative release scenario is estimated to reach a point beyond the facility boundary. One public receptor adjacent to the WWTP, and no environmental receptors are affected in this release scenario.\n\nFailure of a container valve is assumed for the sulfur dioxide alternative case release scenario.  While the toxic endpoint for the sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario is estimated to reach a point beyond the facility boundary, this release scenario affects no public receptors or sensitive environmental receptors designated by EPA.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Gainesville WWTP is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide feed systems and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for each regulated chemical system are documented, and each is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for each regulated chemical system and identified action items are expected to be completed by December 31, 2002.

Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems at the WWTP are also in place.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by facility personnel and whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nPlant operators receive training in the operation of the regulated chemical systems through classes and on-the-job instruction.  Competency is determined through supervisor observation, operator demonstration of activities, and written and oral tests.  Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\nA team of City personnel conducts a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, procedures are in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\nPlant personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release requiring the assistance of offsite emergency response personnel occurs, the City of Gainesville Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community. WWTP personnel communicate regularly with the Fire Department to maintain up to date emergency response plans and procedures for the facility."
