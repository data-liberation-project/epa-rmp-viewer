The Lebanon LP Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Lebanon, OH. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low sulfur diesel/#2 Fuel Oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nLebanon LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Marathon believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Marathon promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Marathon has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Lebanon LP Terminal, located in Lebanon, OH is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility. The butane tank blending process has been classified as Program Level 3. No Program 1 or 2 p"

      "SummaryText": "rocesses containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Lebanon LP Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Lebanon Butane Tank Blending Process.\n\n\n\nThe Butane Tank Injection is a batch type process passed on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports) and piped directly to and injected into the gasoline recirculation line. The butane is pumped by the tanker for direct injection into gasoline lines feeding the product storage tank. Process safety controls include a skid emergency shutoff valve with multiple, manual actuators and fusible element along with a \"Smart-Hose\", low emission hose coupler, and thermal/hydrostatic reliefs. Access to the Lebanon LP Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nThe Lebanon LP Terminal accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning/response programs help Marathon effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and registered in accordance with the Illinois Accidental Release Prevention requirements.

Marathon and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Marathon also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help identify/contain/control a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n\n-Redundant control systems;\n\n-Manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices;\n\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\n\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n\n\n-Process and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity (also actuated via a fusible element);\n\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks; and\n\n-\"Smart-Hose\" with design brea"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, a Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with Clearcreek Fire District.\n\n\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Lebanon LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal keeps records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated, follow-up actions. This is a \"new\" butane tank blending process; consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Clearcreek Fire District and Hillsborough County Office of Emergency Management. A Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Lebanon LP Terminal butane tank blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Clearcreek Fire District and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and 1st Responder Operations capability. The Clearcreek Fire District has participated in butane training sessions for this"

These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the Terminal.\n\n\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nMarathon is continually striving to make the Lebanon LP Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Marathon actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements. All Process Safety Events (as identified in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed, and/or investigated via a root cause analysis (TapRooT) per MPC policy. The Clearcreek Fire District is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Marathon will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns.\n\n"
