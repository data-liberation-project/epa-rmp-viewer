Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Chemply Div. of E+E (US) Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Distribution.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is used for water & wastewater treatment as well as the disenfection of drinking water.  Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] is used for cleaning of steel and other materials.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for declorination in water and wastwater treatment process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements is 704000.00 lb. while Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are expected to be present at our facility in quantities of 38500.00 lb. and 20000.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.
