This location consists of corporate offices, as well as the manufacturing facility which is located in a rural setting.  Access to the facility is through the driveway located on the West Side of the property off state Route 981N. Chestnut Ridge Foam, Inc. uses several processes to manufacture polyurethane, polychloroprene, and natural rubber foam for a variety of applications. The facility manufactures numerous consumer and commercial products containing polyurethane foam materials.  These products include mattresses, and automobile, airplane, and specialty seating.  The facility has purchased flexible urethane blocks, in bulk, for use in these products.  The process includes cutting and shaping of the urethane materials and constructing the final shapes through heating and adhesives.  The use of large quantities of these urethane blocks prompted the company to investigate the generation of these items on-site.\r\n\r\nThe oldest manufacturing process used is known as the \"Dunlap\" process where air is entrained in latex compounds using small \"whip and bowl\" mixers and large foamers.  After air is mixed into the latex compound, a gelatin agent is added which causes the compound to gel after it is poured into a mold.  In one process, the gel is steam-cured in the mold, then washed, and dried after stripping from the mold.  In another process, the gelled foam is stripped from the mold, placed on a rack, air-dried and cured.  In a third process, the latex and air mixture is poured onto a belt where it is scraped level, then gelled, and cured with heat.  The cured foam is used in a variety of applications.\r\n\r\nChestnut Ridge Foam, Inc. uses another process where raw polyurethane foam is purchased from outside vendors, dipped in polychloroprene latex compounds and dried to produce a h"

An additional line utilizes a polyol resin and methylene bisphenyl isocyanate (MDI), which is mixed and poured into molds to produce molded seating cushions.\r\n\r\nThe RMP plan describes the process unit and all programs, practices, and procedures for the manufacture of urethane buns. This process introduces the only Part 68 regulated material at the site.  The batch process uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI), a non-regulated polyol resin, and other chemicals to make flexible urethane buns.  The chemicals are blended in a mixing pot and released into a mold to produce the large polyurethane buns. The buns will be cut to appropriate  and shape and are utilized in the manufacture of a variety of products in several applications.  The process, housed in the West Building, includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n* Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) truck trailer transfer station with integrated dike area\r\n* transfer piping and pumps\r\n* 6000 gallon storage tank (60,180 lb. of TDI)\r\n* transfer piping and pumps with automated/process control transfer/mixing equipment\r\n* 55 gallon mixing tank\r\n* bun mold\r\n* curing area\r\n* fully functional TDI multi-point monitoring system\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nChestnut Ridge has developed an extensive accidental release prevention program and integrated emergency response policies to assure public safety.  The manufacturing process is unique to the industry. Design of the facility was carefully orchestrated, and selection of all auxiliary equipment was made utilizing state of the art criteria.  All design was conducted in accordance with current good engineering practice, current industrial standards (such as ASME codes), conformance with raw material supplier recommendations, and following a process hazard analysis to identify potential design issues.  Any identified issues were corrected prior to final check out of equipment. The management of Chestnut Ridge"
