Lengths of lines and volumes of certain vessels\r\nwere assumed based on good engineering practices. A table of inventory is shown in Appendix\r\n1. Only administrative controls can be credited when limiting volumes in vessels per the General\r\nGuidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68)\r\nchapter 4.2. In order to establish the safest possible environment for EnLink's employees and the\r\npublic, there are no regulated toxic substances above threshold quantities present at the Riptide\r\nGas Plant.\r\nApplicability of Program Levels\r\nLocation of facility\r\nEnLink Midstream Partners operates the Riptide Gas Plant in Martin County, Texas.

A\r\nworst-case scenario considers the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a\r\nvessel or process line failure that results in the greatest affected distance. Since the Riptide Gas\r\nPlant is considered a Program 1 facility, a worst-case scenario for each regulated substance, i.e.\r\nFlammable Mixture and Propane must be considered. The specifics of each worst-case scenario\r\ncan be seen in Appendix 4.\r\nSince this facility was determined to be a Program 1 process, no alternative scenarios were\r\nconsidered.\r\nThe selected worst-case scenario for the Riptide Gas Plant is a release from the Slug Catcher,\r\nSC-100 releasing approximately 784,000 lbs. of a Flammable Mixture. The endpoint to 1 psi of\r\noverpressure for this scenario is 0.7 miles and is the greatest endpoint of all worst-case scenarios\r\nconsidered for each regulated substance at the facility. Therefore, this scenario was the one\r\nselected as the worst-case scenario for the process. It should be noted that the closest public\r\nreceptor is approximately 3,827 ft.

The facility is designed for 100 MMSCFD. The plant consists of the following: inlet\r\ngas separation and filtration, condensate stabilization, inlet compression, amine treatment unit,\r\ndehydration, cryogenic processing unit, refrigeration system, residue compression, flare system,\r\nand all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in\r\nseven 750-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into\r\ntanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue\r\ncompression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage. The Ripley Compressor\r\nStation is currently being built and will be installed within the facility boundary of the Riptide\r\nGas Plant.
