      "SummaryText": "The following provides a brief summary of the key components of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Channelview Cogeneration Facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Channelview Cogeneration Facility is located in Houston, Texas in an industrial setting entirely within the property boundary of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The facility is an electric cogeneration station consisting of four 170-MW, combined-cycle, natural gas-fired turbines coupled to a single steam turbine for electricity generation and steam production.  A duct burner/Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system are associated with each of the gas turbines.  The SCR systems employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is a 29.7% solution of ammonia in water.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at Channelview Cogeneration Facility is comprised of two storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the evaporator for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The tanks have a capacity of 30,000 gallons each but are not filled more than 95% of volume.  The tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves, as well as temperature, pressure, and level indicators.  Ammonia detectors are located on each tank and on the ammonia transfer pump skid.\n\n\n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and fully incorporated in the RMP*Comp, Version 2.01 modeling system.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) considered the catastrophic rupture of one "

      "SummaryText": "of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, in which the entire content of one tank is released within the secondary containment dike.  The secondary containment dike is large enough to contain the entire volume and limits the exposed surface area of a pool, which reduces the release rate.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed and atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), the resulting ammonia cloud could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  This worst-case impact distance extends outside of the Channelview Cogeneration Facility but remains within the outer property boundary of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The ammonia concentrations exceeding the RMP toxic endpoint threshold would not extend beyond the property boundaries of the Equistar Chemical facility.  The WCS does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals), parks, or recreational areas.\n\n\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios (ARSs) were considered including releases due to a failed delivery hose, a failed pipe between the ammonia transfer pumps and an ammonia flow control unit (AFCU), a failed pipe between an AFCU and an evaporator, and a corrosion-caused hole in piping.  The release due to a failed delivery hose resulted in the farthest impact distance (0.1 miles) and this ARS is included in the RMP submitted to the U.S. EPA.  The impact due to the ARS extends outside of the Channelview Cogeneration Facility but remains within the outer property boundary of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The ammonia concentrations exceeding the RMP toxic endpoint threshold would not extend beyond the property boundaries of the Equistar Chemical facility.  The ARS does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals), parks, or recreational areas.\n\n\n\nThere are two water monitors (water curtain systems) located near the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, "

      "SummaryText": "which could serve as active mitigation to knock down an ammonia plume in the event of a release.  The effect of this mitigation measure was not included in the ARS analyses as a conservative approach, since the water monitors would be manually activated.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable spills or accidents associated with the ammonia system within the past five years.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM ELEMENTS\n\n\n\nChannelview Cogeneration Facility ammonia process is subject to an Accidental Release Prevention Program 2 level, which includes the following:\n\n\n\n-     Periodic hazard review and updates\n\n-     Periodic audits of the system and its operation\n\n-     Emergency response plan coordinated with local responding agencies\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components:\n\n\n\n-     Comprehensive plan covering all components of the aqueous ammonia system with respect to operation, maintenance, inspection, and training\n\n-     Internal compliance audits\n\n-     Incident investigation\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nChannelview Cogeneration Facility has arranged for Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex to be the first responders in case of an emergency. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system and a compliance audit were conducted at Channelview Cogeneration Facility as part of the RMP review and update process in March 2014.  The accident release prevention program was found adequate to the requirements and no substantial changes to the system were recommended at that time."
