We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care. requirements and governmental requirements, such as, the Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nUnion Carbide's Taft /Star Plant is a petrochemical manufacturing facility that converts petroleum-based raw materials into a variety of basic building block and intermediate chemicals for customers in many parts of the world.  The facility also produces polyethylene plastic pellets that are shipped worldwide.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Taft /Star Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  . The Union Carbide Taft/Star Complex has 19 chemicals in threshold quantities encompassed by this rule. They are as follows: Acetaldehyde  (f) , Acrolein(t), Ammonia (t) , Butadiene (f) , Butene (f) , Ethane (f) , Ethyl Ether (f) , Ethylene (f) , Ethylene Oxide (t) , Ethylenediamine (t) , Hydrochloric Acid (t) , Hydrogen (f) , Isopentane (f) , Methane (f) , Methyl Mercaptan (t) , Peracetic Acid (t) , Propane (f), Propylene (f), Vinyl Methyl Ether (f)\n\n3.

Key elements include:\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\nEpisodic Risk Management:  Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\nOperational Safety Standards:  Design requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards.\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date.\nOperator Training/Certification Program:  The plant has a training and testing program which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\nTechnical Staff Training and Support:  Trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours a day to support operations.\nMaintenance Procedures:  The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.\nMaintenance Trai"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Taft / Star Complex Plant maintains an emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility\nof a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n*Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n*Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n*Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n*Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n*Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\nThe Taft / Star Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  Information is shared  with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release from our facility. Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S. The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the St. Charles Parish Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\n7.PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard"

      "SummaryText": " analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Taft / Star Complex to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n*A new Corporate program that uses semi-quantitative assessment techniques in process hazard analyses to ensure that controls used for prevention or mitigation of hazards provide adequate protection.\n\n*A new Corporate program designed to ensure that process safety information is kept up-to-date.\n\n*Install a new modified valve handle on Methyl Mercaptan tank car valves to prevent inadvertent operation.\n\n*Union Carbide continues to implement a corporate-wide strategy to avoid computer hardware and software systems operating disruptions due to the year 2000 changeover.  The latest information on the company's Y2K efforts can be found on our Internet site -- \nwww.unioncarbide.com. This information will be periodically updated through first quarter 2000.\n*Reduce the volume of stored ammonia by 50% with a change in operating philosophy to use only one tank of liquid ammonia versus two. Also, install magnetic sight glass in the ammonia storage area which reduces the possibility of an ammonia release or equipment failure and increases the reliability of the existing sight glass at least 100 fold.\n*Modify existing oxide tank car temperature monitoring system during loading operations which reduces the potential for flaring.\n*Upgrade the peracetic acid tank dump interlock system to reduce the possibility of accidental dumps.\n*Implement projects in the peracetic acid unit to reduce risk of equipment failure and emissions i.e., upgrade the material of construction of equipment and the installation of double mechanical seals on unit pumps."
