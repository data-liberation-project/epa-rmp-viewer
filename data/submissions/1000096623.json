      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nTops Markets, LLC's (TML) is engaged primarily in the warehousing and distribution of various frozen food products at our West Seneca Frozen Distribution Center located in West Seneca, New York.  TML has a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\r\n\r\nA.  Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\nTML takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  TML has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates, and emergency procedures designed to enable trained associates to respond quickly to system upsets.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\r\n\r\nB.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations at this facility.\r\n\r\nC.  Description of the Risk Management Plan\r\nThe facility has a PSM/RMP Program that complies with both OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.  The PSM/RMP Program consists of the following elements:\r\nManagement Systems\r\nEmployee Participation Program\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining Program\r\nContractor Safety Program\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\nMechanical Integrity"

Five-Year Accident History\r\nThere have not been any ammonia-related accidents at the facility over the past five years that resulted in offsite consequences as outlined in the Accident History Section of the RMP Submittal.\r\n\r\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility.  The EAP contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local response agencies. \r\n\r\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWe have identified potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system.  All potential changes are documented through meeting notes and/or action lists associated with the PSM/RMP Program."
