OxyChem is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (\u00a7 68.155(a))\n\nOxyChem has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the OxyChem Convent facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the OxyChem Convent facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a7 68.155(b))\n\nThe OxyChem Convent facility consists of several chemical production units that are wholly owned by OxyChem.  OxyChem operates all units at the site.  The facility handles one substance that is regulated by the RMP rule: \t\t\t\n\nChlorine\t\t\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(d))\n\nThe OxyChem Convent facility\u00bfs prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\tProcess Hazard Analysis\tOperating Procedures\nTraining\tMechanical Integrity\tManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Review\tCompliance Audits\tIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\tKey Procedures\tContractors\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and maintained in manuals at the facility.  These manuals are routinely updated.\n\nFive-year Accident"

All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (\u00bfECC\u00bf).  In addition, the OxyChem Convent facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (\u00bfSSP\u00bf) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the St. James Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (\u00bfLEPC\u00bf), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a7 68.155(g))\n\nThe OxyChem Convent facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nOriginal on Cover Letter                                                      Vic Pisani\n--------------------------------------------------                          ----------------------------------------------------\nSignature                                                                             Print Name\n\n\n\n\nPlant Manager"
