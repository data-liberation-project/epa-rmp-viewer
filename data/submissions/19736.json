The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Lake Charles Facility\n\nIt is the policy of Lake Charles facility to operate in a safe manner, with minimum risk to all workers and visitors and to the surrounding community.  While every effort is made to operate the facility safely, it is recognized that accidents can happen.  In order to provide for a coordinated, effective, and timely response to emergency incidents, the Lake Charles facility has developed and implemented the Lake Charles Plant Emergency Plan.\n\n The Lake Charles facility is implementing a program to consolidate and streamline the Compliance Audit requirements as defined in OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (29 CFR 1910.119(o) and the Risk Management Program, 40 CFR 68.79 for various regulated on-site process units.  The consolidation of Compliance Audit Programs is based on minimizing duplication, redundancy, and inconsistency attributed from overlapping state and federal programs. The Lyondell-Lake Charles facility will demonstrate compliance with the two audit programs on an 'overall most stringent compliance audit program' approach.   The 'most stringent overall program' for the regulated process units on-site is defined in the provisions defined in 29 CFR 1910.119(o) - OSHA's Process Safety Management Compliance Audit provisions.\n\n \nII.

While EPA acknowledges that the worst-case scenario is unlikely to occur, other scenarios could occur at the Lake Charles facility. Through the evaluation of these scenarios appropriate emergency response planning discussion can occur.\n\nThe USEPA requires that regulated covered stationary sources handling regulated substances identify worst-case scenarios involving the chemicals located on their site and estimate the possible impact from a catastrophic release. Lyondell - Lake Charles facility evaluated a variety of scenarios using USEPA published guidelines to identify our worst-case scenario. This information must be filed with the USEPA and the Calcasieu Parish LEPC.\n\nPlanning-case (Alternate Release Scenarios) scenarios differ from worst-case scenarios in several important ways. Planning-case scenarios allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential impact of a release on people outside the facility. Further, planning-case scenarios use release estimates based on events, which have happened or are more likely to occur.\n\nAccording to EPA, the Distance-to-Toxic-Endpoint (DTE) is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected under catastrophic conditions. The distance is based on a concentration of the chemical that a person could be exposed to for an hour without suffering irreversible health effects or other symptoms that would make it difficult to escape. It is intended to ensure that potential risks to public health are addressed.  \n\nNote:\nWeather conditions significantly affect the distance to end point when a release occurs. For flammables, although an explosion could occur, it is more likely to disperse harmlessly or burn.\n\nAdditionally, according to the EPA, after a distance"
