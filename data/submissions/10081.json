We also use this information directly to verify that our equipment is suitable for its intended use.  Process Safety Information Details  We maintain the following chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and noncovered processes:  Toxicity Information Permissible Exposure Limits Physical Data Reactivity Data Corrosivity Data Thermal and Chemical Stability Data Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur  We use material safety data sheets (MSDSs) to provide most of the process chemical information.    We maintain the following required process technology information:    Block Flow or Simplified Process Flow Diagram Process Chemistry Maximum Intended Iinventory Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow, or composition Evaluation of the Consequences of Deviations from established operating limits  Most of this information is obtained from engineering design documents for the processes, but in some cases, we have developed such information through special projects.  Additionally, operating limits, maximum intended inventories, and consequences of deviations not available from engineering design documentation were developed as part of PHAs.  We also maintain the following information pertaining to equipment in our regulated processes (as well as for many of our nonregulated processes):  Materials of Construction Piping and Instrument Diagrams (P&IDs) Electrical Classification Relief System Design and Design Bbasis Ventilation System Design Design Codes and Standards Employed Material and Energy Balances for processes built after 6/21/99 Safety systems (interlocks, detection, or suppression systems)     Again, most of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes as well as from our own maintenance files.  Whenever required information was not available, we obtained the information from equipment vendors, process designers, plant engineering, and/or research and development departments.  In conjunction with our equipment information collection efforts, we documented that our equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  For our older processes, where design information is obsolete, our Engineering Department evaluated the existing design against appropriate safety criteria and documented that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.                                                                                                                       PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS  In accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP Rule, we use Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.  The most important products of our PHAs are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  We confirm that all recommendations from our PHAs are resolved appropriately by using a computerized tracking system, and we verify that information from our PHAs (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.  Process Hazard Analysis Details  We conduct systematic PHAs of our regulated processes at our facility according to an established schedule.  This schedule confirms that we (1) address each process in a prioritized order (based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees and/or offsite population, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process) and (2) update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).  We also conduct PHAs of all new processes before those processes are placed in service.    We primarily use the Hazop techniques to perform PHAs, although we use other   EPA-/OSHA-approved techniques such as What-If Checklist  for specific applications.  We conduct our PHAs consistent with the procedures presented in the American Institute of Chemical Engineer's (AIChE's) Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures - Second Edition.  Areas we cover are the following:   Hazards of the Process Identification of any previous incident that had a potential for catastrophic consequences Engineering and Administrative Controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships Consequences of Failure of Engineering and Administrative Controls Stationary Source (plant) siting Human Factors Qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls  Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, including at least one person who has knowledge and experience in the process to be evaluated and a PHA team leader trained in the application and methodology of the hazard evaluation technique used for the PHA.   We have a system in place to promptly resolve PHA team findings and recommendations, and we communicate findings/recommendation resolutions to potentially affected personnel.   PHAs are implemented in a written report for each analysis soon after the analysis meetings are completed.  Our teams review and resolve the PHA recommendations after receiving the report.  We maintain a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date through a corporate tracking system. We document the final resolution of each recommendation, and we advise the PHA team of any recommendations that are rejected.                                                                                                                    OPERATING PROCEDURES  In accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP Rule, we use Operating Procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed to avoid incidents and safely operate the units.  We use these procedures to (1) train our employees/contractors before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.  Operating Procedure Details  Our Process Engineers, Operators, and Shift Supervisors work together to develop and maintain our operating procedures for all phases of operations including:   Initial Startup Normal Operations Temporary Operations Emergency Shutdown, including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner Emergency Operations Normal Shutdown Startup following a Turnaround or after an Emergency Shutdown  Our development teams use PSI, information from process designers/equipment manufacturers, and their own experience to create and validate the procedures.   Our procedures address the following information:   Steps for Safely Conducting Activities  Safe Operating Limits Consequences of Process Deviations, as well as steps required to correct or avoid such deviations Safety and Health Considerations including (1) properties of, and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the process, (2) precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment, (3) control measures to be taken if physical contact or airborne exposure occurs, (4) quality control for raw materials and control of regulated substance inventory levels, and (5) any special or unique hazards  Safety Systems and their functions  In addition to our process-specific procedures, we also develop and maintain more widely applicable safe work practices addressing issues such as Lockout/Tagout, Confined Space Entry, Opening Process Equipment or Piping, and control of access to processes.  These safe work practices apply to our employees and our contractors.    We have a formal review process to approve procedures and changes to procedures.  Furthermore, we annually review existing procedures, make any needed revisions, and certify the procedures as current and accurate.  We keep our procedures in locations that are readily accessible to employees who may need the procedures.                                                                                    TRAINING  In accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP Rule, we train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made.  As part of our training, we include provisions for verifying that employees understand the training (written tests, field demonstrations, etc.).  Training Details  We provide our operators with initial and refresher training, which includes a general overview of the process, properties of chemicals in the process, and safety and health hazards, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  We provide initial training to new hires or newly assigned employees before they are allowed to work independently as operators.  Periodically, at least every three years, we provide our operators with refresher training that, depending on job classification, can include operating procedure training, equipment-specific training, and/or advanced (beyond HAZCOM) chemical-specific training. Our refresher training courses emphasize process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and startup following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group.      All training is accompanied by some form of evaluation to verify that our training has been understood. We use a combination of physical demonstration of skills, oral reviews using a one-on-one format, and written tests.    All training is documented and includes the employee's name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.                                                                                                                      MECHANICAL INTEGRITY  In accordance with Section 68.73 of the RMP Rule, we maintain the Mechanical Integrity (MI) of our process equipment using an Inspection and Testing Program and a Quality Assurance Program, and we verify that our equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly.  We train our maintenance personnel in the hazards of the process, and we also provide additional training on procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of our process equipment so that job tasks are performed safely.  Mechanical Integrity Details  We consider all process-related equipment and safety systems that are critical for preventing and/or mitigating releases of regulated substances to be covered by our MI program.   Examples include:   Pressure Vessels and Storage Tanks Piping Systems including valves Relief and Vent Systems and Devices Emergency Shutdown Systems Controls such as monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks  Our MI Program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that is deteriorating and needs repair or replacement before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return deteriorated equipment to acceptable specifications.  We maintain written procedures that support our MI  Program as follows:     Our Operating Procedures specify functional tests that operators must perform on specific equipment, as well as procedures to remove equipment from operation for maintenance or return equipment to service following maintenance.  Also, temporary operating procedures exist for continuing safe operations when certain equipment deficiencies occur.                                                                                                                               Our standard maintenance procedures describe the methods that mechanics use to perform repairs, replacements, and installations.    Our procedures for safe work practices and safety policies specify safe practices for performing maintenance tasks such as Lockout/Tagout, Hot Work, Confined Space Entry, Line or Equipment Opening, and Control Over Entry/Exit for a Covered Facility by plant and/or contract maintenance personnel.                                                                                                                             Our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance procedures describe the methods used by mechanics to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks on process equipment.  These procedures follow generally accepted good engineering practices.  The equipment inspection and test frequency is based on mean time to failure estimates provided by the manufacturer, adjusted by our own experience.    We document all inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities including:   Date of inspection, test, or preventive maintenance Person performing the activity Equipment identifier Description of the activity performed Results of the activity (including any deficiencies noted)  We identify equipment deficiencies through our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities or from routine operating and maintenance tasks and correct them promptly.  If we cannot immediately correct identified equipment deficiencies, we implement protective measures to confirm safe operation until repairs can be made.  We have a Quality Assurance Program that addresses new facilities, equipment, maintenance materials, and spare parts.  Our program seeks to verify proper fabrication of new equipment, proper installation of new or repaired/replaced equipment, and use of suitable maintenance materials and spare parts in the preventive maintenance and repair tasks.  We have a comprehensive training program covering all MI issues.  Our program uses the procedures described previously.  For example, all mechanics, maintenance supervisors, and maintenance engineers are trained on hazards for all RMP-covered processes and on safe work practices.  Our maintenance personnel also receive training on safe maintenance procedures, preventive maintenance practices, and special skills requiring craft certification. All training, as described above, occurs before employees perform tasks in RMP-covered areas independently.                                                                                                        MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE  In accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP Rule, we evaluate and approve all proposed changes, except replacement-in-kind, to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through our Management Of Change (MOC) Program. This program helps verify that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that our employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes.  We use this close scrutiny of all changes to help confirm that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.  Management of Change Details  We analyze each proposed change and confirm that:  The technical basis for the change is appropriate The safety and health impacts of the change are understood and appropriate controls are in  place The procedures are modified as appropriate for the change The permissible time period is established for temporary changes The change is authorized by appropriate personnel  Our MOC Program contains a step-by-step description of the confirmation process.  It defines and provides examples of changes and replacements-in-kind.  Also, it describes in detail the requirement for each confirmation step based on the type of change being considered.  We use a Request for Change Review and Approval Form to document each step in the confirmation process.  Changes that pass the confirmation criteria are communicated to our employees and contract employees who are affected by the change before the change is implemented.  When approved changes require updates to our Process Safety Information and/or Operating Procedures, we revise these documents and train employees on these changes before operations resume.  All training is documented.                                                                                                            PRE-STARTUP REVIEW  In accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule, we perform a pre-startup review as a final check to verify the safety of a new or modified process before it is placed in service.  Pre-Startup Review Details  We perform Pre-Startup Reviews on new stationary sources and  modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the Process Safety Information.  Our Pre-Startup Review is completed before regulated substances are brought into the process and only after we have confirmed that:  Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications Safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate  PHAs have been performed on new stationary sources and all recommendations have been resolved MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes Training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees  We use a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form as an aid in documenting the performance of our pre-startup reviews. Our checklist contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to startup.  The person responsible for the project or maintenance task prepares the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form and provides the names of the reviewer responsible for confirmation of each of the pre-startup review safety questions.  Each reviewer signs off on the checklist and approval form when satisfied that all assigned safety questions are complete and no problems exist.  All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form before startup can be authorized.                                                                                                                COMPLIANCE AUDITS  In accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP Rule, we audit our RMP-covered processes to be certain that our prevention programs are effective.  Our Compliance Audit Program seeks to confirm that RMP Prevention Program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and  management systems are in place to verify continued compliance.  Compliance Audit Details  We conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM Audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.  The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge:  Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (49 CFR Part 68) Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data Capability to document audit results Knowledge of the process to be audited  Our audit team members use a protocol or a checksheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement.  The Team Leader assigns each auditor specific elements to cover in the audit.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses or noncompliances are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.  We have a Plant Management Committee that promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a computerized tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved.                                                                                                                   INCIDENT INVESTIGATION  In accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP Rule, we perform Incident Investigations to help ensure that incidents with catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence.  Incident Investigation Details  We investigate all incidents (including near misses) that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a large uncontrolled release of a regulated substance, serious injuries to our employees or the public, and/or damage to the environment.  We train our employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur.  We initiate an investigation within 24 hours.  We assemble an investigation team consisting of:  At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved A contract employee if the incident or near miss incident involved the work of a contractor or had acute, adverse health effects on contract employees Others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly investigate and analyze the event as well as an hourly employee.  We train our investigation team leaders in investigation techniques, including root cause analysis.  The investigation team follows a written investigation protocol that addresses the key steps of fact finding, determination of cause, and development of recommendations/actions to be taken.  From the raw data collected, the incident investigation team prepares the text for an incident summary report, which contains:  Date and time of the event Date and time the investigation started Description of the event Identification of contributing factors Recommendations from the investigation  We resolve the report recommendations and develop action plans that are tracked to completion. We review the incident investigation report and action plan items with employees (and contract employees, as appropriate) who work in the affected area and/or perform job tasks relevant to the investigation findings. We accomplish this review by routing a copy of the approved report to potentially affected employees (and contract employees) and by discussing the event at the next safety meeting.  We retain all incidentreports.                                                                                                                       EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION  In accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP Rule, our Employee Participation Plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implemention of PSM elements.  Employee Participation Details  We have a written Employee Participation Program that meets RMP requirements.  In this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations. We distributed draft copies of this document to all employees for review/comment and followed up with a question-answer session in the monthly safety meeting during which we solicit comments and suggestions.  We considered all comments and, where appropriate, revised the draft.  We periodically update this document as changes occur.  We consult with the employees and their representatives on ways to improve participation in the RMP.  Periodically, in our safety meetings, we review results of PHAs and resolutions of their recommendations. The onsite Employee Safety Committee is responsible for maintaining the Sweeny Complex VPP Star status.                                                                                                                        HOT WORK PERMITS  In accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP Rule, we use our Hot Work Permit Program to help ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before Hot Work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near an RMP-covered process.  Hot Work Permit Details  We studied OSHA's fire prevention and protection regulation 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and developed a procedure that addresses these requirements.  We also created a Hot Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed.  We distributed the Hot Work Procedure and Sample Hot Work Permit Forms to employees in safety standards manual and used a workshop approach to train all employees who may use or enforce a hot work permit activity. New employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation.                                                                                                                CONTRACTORS  In accordance with Section 68.87 of the RMP Rule, we have a Contractor Screening Procedure to help ensure that we hire and use only contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of our plant employees, the public, or the environment.  Contractor Details  We have a detailed Contractor Safety Program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process.  This program does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety.  We select contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process.  The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience).  Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record are dropped from further consideration.  Contractors that meet the minimum safety requirements are then judged on who can do a quality job for the best value.  If a contractor currently working in our plant is under consideration, we review recent safety audits and contact our people on the job site to verify satisfactory job performance before we authorize the purchase order.    We provide a safety orientation for Contractor Supervisors before they begin work on site.  (We require these Contractor Supervisors to provide this same safety orientation to their employees who will work in our plant.)  We use the orientation meeting to familiarize contractors with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working. We show a videotape that describes (1) the plant's hazardous chemicals, including toxic, fire/explosion, physical, and chemical properties, (2) safe work practices in use at our facility, and (3) actions they must take in the event of a plant emergency.  We provide copies of our Contractor Safety Manual, which contains plant safety rules/policies, safe work practices, a material hazards summary, and an outline of emergency actions for contractors.  We provide MSDSs for our hazardous materials that may affect the contractor work area, copies of plant safe work practices and policies, and emergency response actions associated with the contractor's work.  We then take the Contractor Supervisors on a tour of the job site to point out the hazards we discussed in the meeting, introduce our personnel with whom they will communicate, identify break and restricted areas, note locations of alarm boxes, and show where medical attention may be provided.    We require our contractors to perform the following tasks to help ensure process safety:   Train each of their employees in the work practices necessary to safely perform the contracted work Provide each of their employees with the same safety orientation that we provide for contractors and supervisors Train each of their employees on our plant's safe work practices Document that each of their employees has received and understands the training noted above  Ensure that each of their employees follows our plant safety rules and safe work practices   Report to our staff any hazards created or found by their employees at the job site Provide access and responses to our personnel who may appear at the job site to evaluate contractor safety performance Provide information on contract employee job site injuries/illnesses to our designated representative",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nClemens Terminal is an underground storage facility of finished and rerun products.  The products stored in the underground storage domes are: Normal Butane, iso-Butane, iso-Pentane, Hydrogen, Natural Gas, Propane, Ethane-Propane mix, Butanes-Butylenes mix, NGL, Propylene, and Ethylene.  In addition to the underground storage domes.  Clemens is capable of treating Ethylene, Propylene, Propane and normal and iso-Butanes for sales.  These five products are treated through a molecular sieve bed for the removal of carry-over water resulting during storage.  Ethylene and Propylene are additionally treated for the removal of Carbon Dioxide resulting from the underground storage.  In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  There are no toxics stored at Clemens Terminal\n \nFlammables:  Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Propylene, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario associated with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum intended inventory of the largest vessel containing a flam"

Typically, it is assumed the entire contents of the vessel are released instantaneously, thus calculating the distance to a 1 pound overpressure endpoint.  However, Clemens Terminal is an underground storage facility with large amounts of storage which cannot be emptied instantaneously.  Modeling was based upon a 10 minute release of a substance in the cavern through a failure of the above ground piping, which is the only piping that enters or exits the cavern.  This piping is considered the closest release point whereby the cavern contents can be released into the atmosphere.  Based on this modeling, our worst case scenario was a failure of the 8\" piping on a NGL underground salt dome storage cavern.  In a 10 minute time period, 3,290,000 pounds of NGL would be released into the atmosphere resulting in a potential vapor cloud explosion.  Due to the piping configuration of the salt domes as stipulated by EPA General Guidance question and answers (Worst Case and Mitigation) 4-11, we have taken credit for passive mitigation.  The resulting vapor cloud explosion would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for flammable substances at Clemens is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of NGL from a 1\" nipple failure on associated piping on above ground piping of a cavern (59,640 pounds released over a 7 minute period).  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 7 minutes (active mitigation).  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  This scenario has no offsite consequences.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Clemens Terminal.  Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PS"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sweeny Complex's Accident Prevention Program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accident Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Clemens Terminal Risk Management System and in the Employee Participation Section of all other Risk Management Elements.  In addition, the terminal has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process safety and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the terminal, including operations, maintenance, engineering and terminal management.  \n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the Employee Behavioral Safety Process (VIPER) and OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  Clemens Terminal received the OSHA VPP Star award as part of the Sweeny Complex overall inspection by OSHA.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Clemens Terminal storage facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the terminal are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information.  Process Safety Information reference documents are readily available as part of the written Emp"

For specific process areas, the terminal has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document.  The terminal verifies the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nClemens Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Clemens Terminal facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nClemens Terminal primarily uses the HAzard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the proc"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Clemens periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nClemens maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, Clemens maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for spe"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Clemens has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nClemens uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

Contractors regularly participate in our emergency drills.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nClemens conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nClemens Terminal has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) Emergency Response Plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC Team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance. Clemens Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nClemens Terminal has developed a team-based defect elimination process known as TPM (Team Perfected Manufacturing).  The objective of this employee driven process is to eliminate equipment failures through predictive and preventive maintenance.  As this process continues to mature we expect continuous and substantial improvement in operating reliability and safety. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nClemens Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a Lockout/Tagout Procedure to verify isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to confirm adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.
