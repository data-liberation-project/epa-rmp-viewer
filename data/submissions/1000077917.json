Additionally, locks are used to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\nWe have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of god that require evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our co"

The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code 424910, Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time.\r\nAt the Gothenburg NE facility, Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and consumed in a process to convert phosphoric acid into liquid fertilizer, 10-34-0 during the early spring and fall months.  The conversion is done by a 3rd party who brings a converter on-site.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the offloading of a semi-trailer transport vehicle.\r\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving of product into storage.
