There will be one process covered under the provisions of 40 CFR 68: (1) A Storage and use of natural gasoline as a denaturant for ethanol.\r\n\r\nVireol Bio Energy adds up to 1.96-2.49% of natural gasoline to denature 200 proof ethanol and make its final product unsuitable for human consumption. Natural gasoline is stored in a 30,000 gallon above-ground storage tank. According to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2), if the concentration of a regulated flammable substance in a mixture is greater than 1% by weight, the entire mixture must be considered in the threshold determination, unless the mixture does not have a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 4. Due to the high variability of pentane and butane concentrations in natural gasoline, the variability of NFPA ratings for gasoline as well as Vireol Bio Energy's desire to maintain flexibility in natural gasoline purchasing options, the storage of natural gasoline is included as a covered process. It is projected that the denatured ethanol would be unlikely to have a NFPA rating greater than 3 and would not be subject to RMP requirements. Vireol Bio Energy has developed a management system with the Plant Manager (PM) as the qualified person with the overall responsibility for implementing and ensuring integration of the risk management program elements. When the responsibilities of implementing individual requirements are assigned to persons other than the PM, their names or positions and their lines of authority have also been defined.\r\n\r\nAlthough the natural gasoline denaturing process is not subject to OHSAAs PSM requirements, Vireol Bio Energy has voluntarily elected to implement similar PSM elements as a best management practice to ensure safety. Therefore, Vireol Bio Energy's prevention program will meet or exceed the RMP Program 2 requirements, and will at a minimum contain a hazard re"

Vireol Bio Energy's plan is to only provide internal response personnel for incipient fires and low level aqueous ammonia emergencies. Therefore, Vireol Bio Energy will incorporate the use of local emergency response organizations into its emergency response plan for more serious emergency events related to the covered processes. The ERP will delineate the decision tree to be used to determine whether to employ onsite or offsite emergency response personnel. While Vireol Bio Energy's level of emergency response would only require an emergency action plan, Vireol Bio Energy has voluntarily elected to develop an ERP that will be compliant with the requirements of the emergency action plan called for under OSHAAs 29 CFR 1910.38a."
