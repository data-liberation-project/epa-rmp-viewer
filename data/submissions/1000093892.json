Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have\r\nbeen reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently.\r\nThe Stephenville WWTP staff are trained only to manage incidental releases related to maintenance and\r\noperation activities and the facility is considered a non-responding facility per 40 CFR 68.90. Emergency\r\nresponse to accidental releases is coordinated with the local fire department and local emergency planning\r\ncommittee.\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Stephenville WWTP utilizes chlorine (regulated substance) as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable\r\npersonnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals\r\n(HHC). Process safety information includes chlorine information, technology of the process information, and\r\nequipment information.\r\nThe PHA completed for this Risk Management Plan (RMP)/Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP)\r\ndocuments the process"

In addition, a Management of Change program has been\r\nestablished to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine system.\r\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and\r\nconstruction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard\r\nanalysis recommendations are resolved prior to start-up."
