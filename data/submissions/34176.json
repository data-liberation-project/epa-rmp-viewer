This facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility uses a real time data base to track inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups. Training is tracked on an internal spreadsheet.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage ( 24 hours - 7 days per week).  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Gwinnett County Department of Fire & Emergency Services ,and the Gwinnett County Hazmat Team,  in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location Kraft Foods  Distributes assorted Kraft products for human consumption. The NAICS code for the primary process at this facility is 42441 ( Sic code 5141). This facility stores and distributes meats and other varieties of refrigerated and frozen as well as non-refrigerated products. Some areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve the meat and refrigerated products.  These areas include: West and South docks, Refrigerated cooler, Freezer, and Cool Room. The backup power source, for these areas, are two diesel powered generators located on the West side of the Refrigerated Distribution Center.\n\nKraft Foods, Norcross has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia at this location.  The Norcross facility has 26,000 lbs. of ammonia on site. Ammonia is used as"

      "SummaryText": " a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the meats and various other refrigerated products in areas described above. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 26,000 lbs.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Kraft Foods in Norcross , Ga.\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially effect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from either system. Although the alternative release scenario is more likely, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated chemical.\n\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Irritation of respiratory tract,\n2.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n3.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n \n\n\n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n This facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in co"

      "SummaryText": "mpliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    Most of the ammonia pipe work is out of the way of people and machinery which lessens the chance of an ammonia release.\n\n.There are many safeguards which provide early warning system to indicate an ammonia release and shut the ammonia system down to minimize the loss of ammonia from the system. These include alarms, process area sensors, perimeter monitors, and automatic system shut-offs.\n.Kraft maintains excellent training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures. Training exercise include classroom lectures and \"on the job\" simulations of an ammonia release. Videotaping of the emergency response team in action during the simulated release provides valuable feedback to responders.\n.A computerized monitoring system is employed to provide accurate measurements of the ammonia system and is connected to the facility's alarm system to immediately warn operators of hazardous conditions.\n\n\n\n5.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 16, 2004.  To date, there have been no accidental spills or releases of ammonia at this facility as defined by 40 CFR part 68.42.\n\n\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program\n\n As mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams. There are two primary in-plant contacts for an emergency, which can be found in the Emergency Response Plan.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training as well as a detailed description of the training content.  There are also specific"

The Gwinnett County Hazmat Team will be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where the fire department is called, an ambulance will also be called to the scene.\n\n7.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the PHA completed for ammonia a list of action items was developed and is being monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished.
