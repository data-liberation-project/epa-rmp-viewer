The facility is a producer of custom and branded frozen sandwiches and dough related products for food marketers and manufacturers, the food service industry, and retailers in the United States. \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 31141. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating sandwich ingredients and products. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 17,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks, and blast freezers.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The ultra low pressure equipment contains two (2) blast freezer evaporators with two (2) surge drums, one (1) ultra low temperature accumulator (ULTA-1) with transfer vessel and oil pot, and two (2) booster compressors.  The low pressure equipment contains four (4) freezer evaporators, one (1) low temperature accumulator (LTA-1) with transfer vessel and oil pot, and two (2) single stage compressors.  The intermediate pressure equipment contains four (4) cooler evaporators, five (5) corridor evaporators, fifteen (15) process room evaporators, four (4) dock evaporators, one (1) glycol chiller, one high temperature accumulator (HTA-1) with transfer vessel and oil pot, one (1) intercooler with oil pot, and three (3) high stage compressors.

Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Nation Pizza Products. \r\n\r\nXI.\tManagement Program\r\nNation Pizza Products has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Currently, Harry Dunker, Plant Manager, is responsible for implementation of the overall Risk Management Program."
