(H.C.S.), in their effort to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace and possibly to the surrounding community has established an Accidental Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68).  The purpose of the accidental release prevention program and emergency response program is to protect employees, neighbors, and the community from serious injury, property loss, or loss of life, in the event of an actual or potential major disaster.  A major disaster may include, but is not limited to, any of the following: fire, tornado, earthquake, bomb threat, or hazardous chemical spill.  In the event of a major disaster, the H.C.S. Emergency Action Plan in accordance with the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38(a) describes initial responsibilities and actions to be taken to protect all employees until the appropriate municipal responders take action. In addition, H.C.S. is included in the community emergency response plan as developed under 42 U.S. C. 11003.  \nSenior Management is committed to the safety and well being of employees, personnel, neighbors, the community, and the environment. Through superior leadership and continued commitment, a safe workplace environment has been created.  Personnel strive to implement quality programs which enhance safety not only throughout the organization but through the community as well.  \nTo control offsite hazards, H.C.S. has developed the necessary expertise, experience, judgment and proactive initiative within the workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective risk management program as envisioned in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions 40 CFR Part 68 standard.  \nAppropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response for example the Emergency Action Plan, Logix Se"

Emergency Action Plan also includes procedures for handling ammonia releases including small ammonia leaks.  H.C.S. relies on municipal and state response agencies to respond to ammonia releases, therefore H.C.S. is not subject to 29CFR 1910.120(a).  H.C.S. does not conduct operations at treatment, storage and disposal (TSD) facilities specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of 29CFR 1910.120 regulated by 40 CFR part 264 and 265 pursuant to RCRA; or by agencies under agreement with U.S.E.P.A. to implement RCRA regulations, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(p).\nH.C.S. employees are not engaged in emergency response.  All emergencies are responded to by emergency response organizations that have developed and implemented programs equivalent to 29CFR 1910.120(q). \nThe Chief Engineer, Assistant Engineer or trained employees in the immediate area of incidental releases of anhydrous ammonia may respond where it can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release.   The Chief Engineer and the   Assistant Engineer are considered maintenance personnel.  Response to incidental releases are not considered to be emergency responses within the scope of 1910.120 (see 1910.120 (a) Scope: Emergency Response Corresponding to Emergencies).  \nH.C.S. policy requires employees evacuate from the danger area (if possible) when and if an emergency occurs.  H.C.S. does not permit employees to assist in an emergency therefore, H.C.S. is exempt from the requirement of 29 CFR 1910.120(q) because they have developed an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 (a).     \nb)  Stationary source and regulated substances handled:  \nHenningsen Cold Storage Co. is a Public Refrigerated Warehouse.

A detector is mounted in each freezer/cooler room, as well as in each engine room.  If ammonia is detected, a two level stage alarm system is utilized.  This is dependant upon the ammonia concentration detected and the location of the detector.  \nThe first detection limit is set at 50ppm.  If exceeded, the detector will send an alert to the Simplex 2001 central ammonia alarm panel.  The Simplex panel signals the Honeywell monitored security system, notifying the alarm company.  The alarm company in turn contacts H.C.S. personnel using a call-list which includes appropriate personnel, pager number and phone numbers.  \nIf ammonia is detected in either of the engine rooms, the automatic ventilation fans will automatically start in an attempt to clear the alarm.  A second detection level is set at 100 ppm.  Sensing this level, the detector sends an \"ammonia leak\" alarm to the central panel, notifying the alarm company of an ammonia leak of a serious nature.   The alarm company contacts appropriate H.C.S. and emergency personnel via a call-list as mentioned above.\nIn the event of an ammonia leak or release H.C.S. personnel (other than the Chief Engineer/Maintenance never respond directly to an ammonia leak where an IDLH level of ammonia (>300 ppm) is present. Mitigation strategies may only be used when they can be performed from a remote location where there is no possibility of exposure to dangerous levels of ammonia.
