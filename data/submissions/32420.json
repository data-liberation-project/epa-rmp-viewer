Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Corporation Tucker, Georgia  Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both  Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Tucker Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 100 million pounds of latex.  Latex is sold primarily to customers who use the material in the making of latex interior and exterior paints and coatings.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Tucker Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Tucker Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at levels above the threshold amounts: \n\n-Acrylonitrile\n-Vinyl Acetate\n\nThe Tucker plant has two processes. One process is the manufacture of latex. The second process is the support activities for rail transportation which is the storage area for bulk chemicals used in the production of latex.\n\nThe Tucker plant has no RMP-regulated flammable substances.\n \n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and implementation of Loss Prevention Principles (LPP) which consist of design, installation,modification a"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standards that these management systems set.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Union Carbide Tucker Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tucker Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion "

In addition, the two fire stations that would normally serve the facility are invited to tour the facility periodically tour the facility when new firemen join the stations.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  \n\n6.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.\n  \nThe company will increase efficiency by leveraging across the businesses most effective technology (MET), standardized work processes defined using Six Sigma, and other best practices. \n\nTo continuously enhance resource productivity to reduce risk, minimize the company's  impact on the environment and health and increase global competitiveness through greater efficiency; to emphasize pollution prevention in the process; to transfer and use the best available technology throughout the company.\n\nContinue to embrace and advocate Responsible Care"
