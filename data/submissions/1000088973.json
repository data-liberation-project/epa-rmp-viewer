The purpose of the facility is to generate chlorinated solution which is used to disinfect the Pittsfield water supply.  The Cleveland Chlorinator Facility currently stores up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine in three one-ton containers. The chlorinator facility is a dedicated building less than one mile away from the water treatment plant which is located next to the Cleveland Reservoir. Since the Cleveland Chlorinator Facility stores more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine, the facility is required to comply with the re"

      "SummaryText": "currently the only substance that is stored onsite in amounts greater than the regulated threshold.  Chlorine is contained as a liquefied gas in one-ton containers and utilized as a disinfecting agent at the facility.  In this analysis, an electronic tool called RMP*Comp was utilized to perform the off-site consequence analysis required under the RMP Rule. RMP*Comp makes the same calculations that you calculate manually by following the procedures described in EPA's guidance document. At the time of the analysis, the most current version was RMP*Comp 2.01.\r\nThe consequence of a chlorine release from a container is independent of the type of storage.  EPA's RMP Guidance provides the methods used to determine the release rates. Through chlorine-specific tables, the distance from each facility to the point at which a toxic concentration would be detected if a release occurred can then be estimated. \r\nIn performing a worst-case scenario analysis, a ten-minute release under worst case meteorological conditions (F stability , 1.5 m/sec (3.4 mile/hr) wind speed and 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) ambient air temperature) were used.  These meteorological conditions can be thought of as a clear night and light wind, typical of early morning hours when the air is moderately still.  The worst-case scenario also assumes that all releases occur at ground level. \r\nAfter determining the release rate, the RMP Guidance reference table provided the distance to the toxic endpoint by utilizing the release rate and the topography of the area.  The RMP Guidance suggests that the closest value to the calculated value be used if the release rate values fall between two values.  The chlorine specific equation for rural topography from distance to toxic endpoint in miles (D) was determined from the reference table as 1.3 miles for the worst-case release scenario.  \r\nIn addition to investigating the worst-case scenario for an accidental release, a Risk Management Plan requires that an alternative release scen"

Chlorine in its gaseous state has a greenish-yellow color and has a pungent irritating odor similar to bleach. Chlorine is neither explosive nor flammable, but as a strong oxidant supports combustion. Chlorine gas can react violently with greases, turpentine, ammonia, hydrocarbons, metal filings, and other flammable materials. Chlorine gas will not conduct electricity, but will be very corrosive to exposed electrical equipment. Dry chlorine gas will not corrode steel or other metals but is extremely corrosive to most metals in the presence of moisture. The compression of chlorine gas creates chlorine liquid. Liquid chlorine changes easily to a gas at room temperatures and pressures.  \r\nThe RMP regulation identifies three separate sets of requirements for process classified as Program 1, Program 2 or Program 3.  This facility is subject to the Program 3 Risk Management Program, comprised of the following five elements:\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\u00bf\tOff-site Hazard Assessment\r\n\u00bf\tAccident Prevention Program\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Program, and\r\n\u00bf\tRisk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nFigure 1:  Conceptual Depiction of the Cleveland Chlorinator\r\n  \r\nSource:  Hydro InstrumentsTM Automatic Switchover Gas Chlorination Systems Series 900 Instruction Manual, S900 rev. 6/27/19\r\n\r\n3.0  OFF-SITE HAZARDS ASSESSMENT\r\nRMP requires that two off-site hazard assessments be conducted, a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  The consequences of these releases are assessed by using mathematical models to estimate the distance to toxic or flammable endpoints specified in the regulation.
