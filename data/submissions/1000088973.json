The City of Pittsfield has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the RMP and emergency response programs.  This management system identifies lines of responsibility for the entire program and each of its key elements.

The Cleveland Chlorinator Facility currently stores up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine in three one-ton containers. The chlorinator facility is a dedicated building less than one mile away from the water treatment plant which is located next to the Cleveland Reservoir.

Chlorine in its gaseous state has a greenish-yellow color and has a pungent irritating odor similar to bleach. Chlorine is neither explosive nor flammable, but as a strong oxidant supports combustion. Chlorine gas can react violently with greases, turpentine, ammonia, hydrocarbons, metal filings, and other flammable materials. Chlorine gas will not conduct electricity, but will be very corrosive to exposed electrical equipment. Dry chlorine gas will not corrode steel or other metals but is extremely corrosive to most metals in the presence of moisture. The compression of chlorine gas creates chlorine liquid. Liquid chlorine changes easily to a gas at room temperatures and pressures.  \n\nThe RMP regulation identifies three separate sets of requirements for process classified as Program 1, Program 2 or Program 3.  This facility is subject to the Program 3 Risk Management Program, comprised of the following five elements:\n\n?    Management Program\n\n?    Off-site Hazard Assessment\n\n?

The consequences of these releases are assessed by using mathematical models to estimate the distance to toxic or flammable endpoints specified in the regulation.  A circle centered at the modeled release with a radius equal to the endpoint distance is drawn on a map satellite photograph and the types of public receptors that are located within that circle are determined and reported in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nAt the Cleveland Chlorinator site, chlorine gas is"

The three alternative scenarios included:\n\n?    Flashing Liquid Release;\n\n?    Choked Vapor Release;\n\n?

Chlorine is contained as a liquefied gas in one-ton containers and utilized as a disinfecting agent at the facility.  In this analysis, an electronic tool called RMP*Comp was utilized to perform the off-site consequence analysis required under the RMP Rule. RMP*Comp makes the same calculations that you calculate manually by following the procedures described in EPA's guidance document. At the time of the analysis, the most current version was RMP*Comp 2.01.\n\nThe consequence of a chlorine release from a container is independent of the type of storage.  EPA's RMP Guidance provides the methods used to determine the release rates. Through chlorine-specific tables, the distance from each facility to the point at which a toxic concentration would be detected if a release occurred can then be estimated. \n\nIn performing a worst-case scenario analysis, a ten-minute release under worst case meteorological conditions (F stability , 1.5 m/sec (3.4 mile/hr) wind speed and 25 ?C (77 ?F) ambient air temperature) were used.  These meteorological conditions can be thought of as a clear night and light wind, typical of early morning hours when the air is moderately still.  The worst-case scenario also assumes that all releases occur at ground level. \n\nAfter determining the release rate, the RMP Guidance reference table provided the distance to the toxic endpoint by utilizing the release rate and the topography of the area.  The RMP Guidance suggests that the closest value to the calculated value be used if the release rate values fall between two values.  The chlorine specific equation for rural topography from distance to toxic endpoint in miles (D) was determined from the reference table as 1.3 miles for the worst-case release scenario.  \n\nIn addition to investigating the worst-case scenario for an accidental release, a Risk Management Plan requires that an alternative release scen"

The operating procedures, emergency prepared?ness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are all documented so that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is continuously available to employees. \n\nThe City of Pittsfield is considering several changes to improve safety including:  the installation of an external emergency eye wash, the installation of beacons and horns both inside and outside the facility and is also assessing the replacement of the chlorine gas disinfection system with a sodium hypochlorite system. \n\n"
