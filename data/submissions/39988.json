The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Akron Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammoniaby utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire dept and the local emerency planning committee so that they can plan for any response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  Product may also be loaded into semi trailers for sale and distribution to other local dealers.  The maximum quantity stored would be 336,000 pounds in the facility's three permanent storage tanks.  The capacities of these tanks are: 140,000 pounds and 196,000 pounds tied together in a 140,000 pound and 56,000 tank.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest tank on site tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 196,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank combination at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2.68 miles.\nThe alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 26638 pounds over 2 minutes when the release is controlled .  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 1.56 miles.\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consis"

The Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6. The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
