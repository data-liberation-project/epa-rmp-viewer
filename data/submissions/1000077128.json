      "SummaryText": "Par Hawaii Refining - Par West Refinery \n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n June 2019\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) was developed in accord with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations coded in 40 CFR 68. It is intended to prevent and limit the impact of potentially toxic and flammable substances from being accidentally released by the refinery. The RMP includes a facility-wide review of potential hazards, a worst-case, alternative case and off-site consequences analysis, and implements a formal management system for managing and minimizes those risks.   The RMP is just one element of Par's commitment to safety and protection of employees, the surrounding community and environment. \n\n\n\nSAFETY COMMITMENT\n\n\n\nThe following corporate policy statement expresses Par's overall commitment to safety and the prevention of accidental releases which could impact the community.  \n\n\n\nPar considers safety an integral part of its performance.  At Par we believe:\n\n?    All accidents can be prevented.\n\n?    Safety is not to be compromised for any reason.\n\n?    Each employee is responsible for their own safety and working safely is a condition of employment.\n\n?    Management is accountable for accident prevention\n\n?    Trained employees are an essential element for safe workplaces.\n\n?    All operating exposures can be safeguarded.\n\n?    Immediate corrective action shall be taken on all unsafe practices and incidents with injury or damage potential. \n\n\n\nComplying with the requirements of OSHA's Process Management System (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) will help protect employees as well as the surrounding communities and environment. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Par West Refinery is located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The Refinery operates several processing units to produce petroleum products (e.g. jet, naphtha diesel, fuel oil, propane) from crude oil. \n\n\n\nPortions of the refinery are subject to regulation under EPA's Risk Management P"

Flammable mixtures include methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, butane, and pentane and light and whole straight run naphtha and are generally produced as a consequence of refining crude oil.  There are no toxic substances stored on-site in excess of the threshold quantities, specified by 40 CFR 68. \n\n \n\nIn December of 2018 the refinery was subdivided into a bulk terminal facility and refinery process units. Par Hawaii Refining acquired the crude and vacuum units and utility systems required to sustain their operations.  The supporting utility system include a flare/relief system, 2 boilers and 4 cogeneration units and the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) which is used to treat waste water before it is discharged through NPDES permitted outfall to the Pacific Ocean.   Par Hawaii Refining purchased some additional process units including the acid plant, hydrogen manufacturing unit, hydrogenation and isomerization unit and several columns in the FCC and alkylation plants, but these units are not being operated. Because there are no plans to operate them at this time, the idled equipment has been isolated and purged with nitrogen.  Although refinery fuel gas and light naphtha are present and used as fuels to fire the boilers and  cogeneration units, the amount flammable substances (fuel)  in the supply lines is well below the 10,000 lb applicability threshold criteria established under 40 CFR 68.  Because much of the refinery has been idled and purged, most of the flammable mixtures are generated and held within the crude unit (which includes the vacuum unit and vapor recovery system).\n\n \n\nIn addition to the crude unit, the refinery has two flares, which are or can be inter-connected. When the flammable mixtures associated with both flares is aggregated as a singular system, the flares are also considered a covered process under RMP. \n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL R"

This summary describes each RMP Program 3 Prevention Program in place at the refinery, which are aligned with the OSHA PSM elements. The objective of the RMP prevention programs and the PSM system is to reduce the consequences and/or likelihood of potential accidents at the refinery.\n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\no    Employees are actively involved in each element of the RMP prevention program at the refinery. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, operating & maintenance procedures, and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information generated from the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention programs are documented in an employee participation policy that is maintained at the refinery. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives often include forming committees to address process and personal safety. The committees typically have members from various workgroups, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Regularly scheduled meetings are held with various employee groups to address a variety of process and personal safety topics.\n\n\n\n?

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA studies. Management reviews are regularly performed to ensure the quality of investigation program.\n\n\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\no    The refinery maintains a variety of procedures, drawings and technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents contain safety related information on topics such as process operation, process equipment, chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis. The documents which are categorized as process safety information are defined in a policy maintained at the refinery.

The team's recommendations are reviewed with the appropriate management representatives and after concurrence, the recommendation list is distributed for follow-up and communicated to all affected employees. A copy of the final report is maintained in the refinery main library and is available to all employees. The PHA team's recommendations are assigned to individuals to develop action plans for resolution. The action plans are tracked to ensure that all items are completed in a timely manner. Actions taken to resolve recommendations are reviewed and approved by management and documented in a system maintained at the refinery. PHA's are revalidated at least every five years.

Training\n\no    To complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operators must first successfully complete a comprehensive series of classroom training sessions on refinery operations. The new operators are then paired up with more experienced operator to learn process specific procedures, duties and tasks. After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they have an adequate knowledge to perform the plant operating duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. The operator is then fully qualified upon completion of the Formal Operating Training Program requirements. In addition, operations personnel receive refresher training on operating procedures at least every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained. All training is documented and kept on record in the Refinery's Training and Development Department.\n\n\n\n?

The refinery also requires contractors to participate in key activates, such as tailgate meetings, safety and environmental audits, and work audits.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
