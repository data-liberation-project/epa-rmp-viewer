It is intended to prevent and limit the impact of potentially toxic and flammable substances from being accidentally released by the refinery. The RMP includes a facility-wide review of potential hazards, a worst-case, alternative case and off-site consequences analysis, and implements a formal management system for managing and minimizes those risks.   The RMP is just one element of Par's commitment to safety and protection of employees, the surrounding community and environment. \r\n\r\nSAFETY COMMITMENT\r\n\r\nThe following corporate policy statement expresses Par's overall commitment to safety and the prevention of accidental releases which could impact the community.  \r\n\r\nPar considers safety an integral part of its performance.  At Par we believe:\r\n\u00bf\tAll accidents can be prevented.\r\n\u00bf\tSafety is not to be compromised for any reason.\r\n\u00bf\tEach employee is responsible for their own safety and working safely is a condition of employment.\r\n\u00bf\tManagement is accountable for accident prevention\r\n\u00bf\tTrained employees are an essential element for safe workplaces.\r\n\u00bf\tAll operating exposures can be safeguarded.\r\n\u00bf\tImmediate corrective action shall be taken on all unsafe practices and incidents with injury or damage potential. \r\n\r\nComplying with the requirements of OSHA's Process Management System (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) will help protect employees as well as the surrounding communities and environment. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Par West Refinery is located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.

Flammable mixtures include methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, butane, and pentane and light and whole straight run naphtha and are generally produced as a consequence of refining crude oil.  There are no toxic substances stored on-site in excess of the threshold quantities, specified by 40 CFR 68. \r\n \r\nIn December of 2018 the refinery was subdivided into a bulk terminal facility and refinery process units. Par Hawaii Refining acquired the crude and vacuum units and utility systems required to sustain their operations.  The supporting utility system include a flare/relief system, 2 boilers and 4 cogeneration units and the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) which is used to treat waste water before it is discharged through NPDES permitted outfall to the Pacific Ocean.   Par Hawaii Refining purchased some additional process units including the acid plant, hydrogen manufacturing unit, hydrogenation and isomerization unit and several columns in the FCC and alkylation plants, but these units are not being operated. Because there are no plans to operate them at this time, the idled equipment has been isolated and purged with nitrogen.  Although refinery fuel gas and light naphtha are present and used as fuels to fire the boilers and  cogeneration units, the amount flammable substances (fuel)  in the supply lines is well below the 10,000 lb applicability threshold criteria established under 40 CFR 68.  Because much of the refinery has been idled and purged, most of the flammable mixtures are generated and held within the crude unit (which includes the vacuum unit and vapor recovery system).\r\n \r\nIn addition to the crude unit, the refinery has two flares, which are or can be inter-connected. When the flammable mixtures associated with both flares is aggregated as a singular system, the flares are also considered a covered process under RMP. \r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL R"
