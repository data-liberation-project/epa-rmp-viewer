Accidental Release Program ad Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nThe management and staff at the Pryor Chemical Plant are strongly committed to safety for our employees, the public, and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as process design, installation, operating procedures, system maintenance, and employee training.  It is a facility policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances where possible.\n\n2. The facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Pryor Chemical Plant manufactures nitrogenous fertilizer.  The facility has been mothballed since 1999.  The facility intends to resume manufacturing operations in July 2009.  The facility processes Natural Gas to produce Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the following processes or areas of the process: ammonia manufacturing, ammonia storage and loading, and urea manufacturing. The largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility is 15,000 tons or 30,000,000 lbs. \n\n3. General Accidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements per 40 CFR Part 68. When the facility is brought out of mothball and into start-up, the facility will be in compliance with these requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility:\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nPryor Chemical Company maintains detailed safety information for chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs for all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility previously conducted a comprehensive PHA while the facility was operational to identify hazards associated with the process"

The facility conducted a recent study to update the hazard identification and controls in anticipation of startup of the facility following a mothball period.  The most recent PHA/Update was conducted on 3/5/2009.  The methodology used to conduct the recent analysis was HAZOP.   The PHA is conducted by qualified personnel with expertise in the process operations/engineering and PHA areas.  In the future, the PHA will be revalidated on a regular interval of every 5 years.\n\n\n\nOperational Procedures\n\nThe Pryor Chemical Company maintains up-to-date written operating procedures to assure that facility activities are conducted safely. These procedures address various modes or portions of the process.  Some of the key procedures include: product loading, initial startup, normal process operations, normal process shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  These procedures will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.  The procedures are available to all operators involved in the respective processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Pryor Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operational procedures associated with their job duties. Training will be conducted prior to facility start up, and refresher training will be provided every year, or more frequently as needed. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility will perform documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment inspected by these checks include at a minimum: storage tanks, pressure vessels, piping systems, loading areas, relief and vent systems, key valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.   Maintenance is completed by qualified personnel.  Equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance inspections will be corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in processes, equipment, and chemical sto"

Personnel whose job tasks are affected by these changes will be made aware of the changes in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nPre-Start Up Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes or modifications will be conducted as a regular practice. A pre-start up review was conducted prior to bringing the facility online following the long term facility mothball.  PSSR was conducted between 6/8/2009 ? 6/12/2009 by an outside consulting company.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAs a company, audits are regularly conducted at company facilities.   This facility will have audits conducted on a regular basis. Generally, audits are conducted every year.  Corrective actions based upon audit findings are implemented in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPryor Chemical Company investigates all incidents resulted in or could have resulted in a release of a regulated substance. These investigations are competed to determine root-cause and to implement corrective actions to prevent future incidents or near-misses.  All reports are retained for at least 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPryor Chemical Company knows that process safety management and accident prevention must be a team effort in order to be a success. Employees are encouraged to be knowledgeable about the facility?s RMP program, which is accessible to all employees and to provide input on accident prevention practices.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nContractors are hired by the company to conduct specialized services to the facility.  Prior to selecting a contractor, the Pryor Chemical Company completes a thorough evaluation of the company?s safety performance.  Only contractors that meet our company?s safety expectations are hired to provide services.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n4.

Emergency Response Program:\n\nRequirement:  Briefly describe the elements of the response program such as coordination with local emergency responders, training received by personnel, drills conducted by the facility, public notification and alert systems, as appropriate.\n\nExample/Draft:\n\nPryor Chemical Company has a written emergency response plan for implementation during an accidental release of regulated materials.  The response plan contains emergency response aspects such as first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification to local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident procedures.  The Pryor Fire Department is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency response activities are coordinated.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nRequirement:  List any upcoming events such as training, installation of new mitigation or control equipment or technology, organizational changes, that will improve safety at the facility.\n\nExample/Draft:  \n\nPryor Chemical Company plans to continue improving and enhancing our safety program.  This facility is being brought online after being mothballed for several years. The following equipment is planned to be installed:  \n\n* New Plant Wide Emergency Notification System - consisting of a Whelen Vortex 3 emergency notification siren to update our emergency action plan. It is a remote wireless activated rotating siren to enhance the facility?s Emergency Action Plan centered in the facility and at an elevation of 60 feet. \n\n* New Radio Communication System - the system will be installed in the control room along with 44 hand-held radios for employee communication. This will help with emergency communications in the case of a plant upset, an issue at a neighboring facility, or a weather emergency.  \n\n"
