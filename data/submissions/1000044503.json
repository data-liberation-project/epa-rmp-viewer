A written copy of the RMP is available to Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public, upon request. The key elements of the RMP are presented below.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\n\n\nThe Dominick's 555 Warehouse maintains a refrigeration system used to refrigerate grocery products on site prior to distribution to various stores. Ammonia is the refrigerant used in the refrigeration systems. The ammonia refrigeration systems are closed-loop systems and consist of vessels, piping, valves, and other process equipment. All refrigeration vessels are located inside the warehouse buildings. The Freezer system is charged with 49,275 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle consists of compressing and expanding ammonia and changing the physical state from high pressure liquid, to low pressure liquid, to low pressure vapor, to high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (e.g. lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature). Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 0 psig on the low-pressure side to approximately 180 psig on the high pressure side. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is a very efficient refrigerant. It is the most environmentally friendly refrigerant in existence and does not contribute to global warming. It has been in use successfully as a refrigerant for more than"

Dominick's has been using ammonia at the 555 Warehouse for over 36 years with only one (1) OSHA reportable incident.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nManagement System: The Dominick's 555 Warehouse management is committed to chemical safety and adheres to the following policies:\n\n\n\n+ To ensure the refrigeration system integrity,\n\n+ To provide necessary training for personnel responsible for the refrigeration system,\n\n+ To provide appropriate release response and reporting training for all employees.\n\n+ To properly train select staff as emergency response personnel,\n\n+ To have a direct line of emergency reporting with the agencies and management,\n\n+ To have appropriate emergency response equipment onsite, and\n\n+ To work with local authorities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nTechnological and procedural/managerial practices have been implemented to improve the overall facility prevention program. For example, the ammonia refrigeration system is continually being monitored and controlled by an Andover monitoring and control system. The Andover system controls the mechanical functions, which ensures proper operation of the refrigeration system. Various redundant safety control parameters are built into the program. Indoor area monitors are located in the compressor rooms to detect system releases.\n\n\n\nPersonnel responsible for the refrigeration system receive OSHA, on-the-job, and industry recommended training. Physical equipment inspections are conducted daily.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Update which conducted a review of the accident history during the last five years (March 2009 through February 2014), the 555 Warehouse has not had an accidental release or \"near miss\" of ammonia. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe 555 Warehouse has prepared an Emergency Action Plan which outlines the reporting, notification, evacuation, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to e"

To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSelect warehouse personnel (responders) have been properly trained to respond to a release of ammonia that is under the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health concentration level of 300 ppm. The necessary safety equipment for responding to releases that do not exceed 300 ppm is stored onsite in strategic designated areas. Emergency response drills are conducted onsite.\n\n\n\nDominicks has worked with the Northlake Fire Department to provide details on the site operations and emergency response capabilities (under 300 ppm). In the event of an accidental release, DominickA?s responders will assume overall responsibility for the response while the Fire Department personnel will secure evacuated personnel, provide medical surveillance and support for responders, and work with the Local Emergency Planning Committee for public action, if required.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Dominick's 555 Warehouse has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis. Both studies resulted in minor procedural modifications to ensure a safe operation.  The Facility Maintenance Manager, together with the Corporate Environmental Affairs Manager are responsible for ensuring that these recommendations are implemented. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the mitigation measures included in the Compliance Audit and Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, the Process Safety Management team continues to ensure employee involvement in Safety Plan Development and training requirement protocol."
