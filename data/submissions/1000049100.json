It is the WWTP's intent to enforce the policies and procedures presented in this document to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances or reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.  \n\n\n\n1.0 SOURCE & SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility (SIC Code 4952, NAICS 221320) is responsible for treating residential, commercial, and some industrial wastewater for the Town of Wytheville and parts of Wythe County.  Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Services, CAS Number 7782-50-5) is used to disinfect treated wastewater and sulfur dioxide (CAS number is 7446-09-5) is used to reduce or eliminate the chlorine residual following the disinfection and prior to discharge. The WWTP stores on-site up to 3 one-ton cylinders of chlorine and up to 3 one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\n2.0 RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nIn accordance with federal regulation, plant management has modeled two accidental release scenarios:\n\n'worst-case' and 'alternative-case' for each substance. The Worst-Case Analysis uses conservative\n\nassumptions to determine the greatest distance that a release will travel before it is not longer a hazardous\n\nthreat. The Alternative-Case Analysis demonstrates an off-site impact for a smaller release. Each scenario is\n\ndescribed briefly below.\n\n\n\nA) Worst-Case Scenario for Chlorine of Sulfur Dioxide Release\n\nThe worst-case scenario results for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are identical. The worst-case scenario\n\ndescribes a situation in which a one-ton storage container of either gas releases all 2,000 pounds of the gas it\n\ncontains in ten minutes. Under stable atmospheric conditions with a one and one-half meter per second\n\nwind, toxic concentrations of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas would spread to a radius of 0.9 miles from the\n\nrelease site, af"

Accordingly, safety inspections and safety plans have been completed to help prevent such an occurrence.\n\n\n\nB) Alternative-Case Scenario for Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide Release\n\nThe alternative-case scenario results for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are identical. The alternative-case\n\nscenario describes a situation in which a one-ton storage container of either gas suffers a valve failure and\n\nreleases 900 pounds of its gas in 15 minutes. Under slightly unstable atmospheric conditions with a three\n\nmeter per second wind, toxic concentrations of chlorine or sulfur dioxide would travel to a radius of 0.2 miles\n\nfrom the release site, affecting the municipal facility only. Safety inspections and safety plans are in effect to ensure against this type of release.\n\n\n\nSeveral mechanisms already in place ensure quick response time and release control. These mechanisms\n\ninclude relief valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, and emergency procedures. Also, the placement of chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers within an enclosed structure slows spread time, therefore increasing time for emergency response and public notification. Control mechanisms serve to make both release scenarios highly unlikely.\n\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY & ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Town of Wytheville Wastewater Treatment Plant can certify that there have been no releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years that have resulted in any off site impact. The plant is proud of its accident-free history and has put into effect an extensive accidental release prevention program to maintain its excellent safety record.\n\n\n\nAs an affected facility under Occupational Health and Safety Act Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM)\n\nrequirements, the plant is a Program 3 participant. The most extensive of the three RMP programs, Program 3 includes a number of requ"

      "SummaryText": "irements that closely track OSHA PSM requirements. Program 3 also focuses on the off-site consequences of an accidental release. The prevention program outlines information and procedures regarding all aspects of safe operation, including process safety information, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), operating procedures, mechanical integrity, and personnel training.\n\n\n\nThe PHA is designed to be conducted by a cross-section of facility employees, with guidance from employees\n\ndirectly involved in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes. The PHA team identifies, evaluates, and\n\nimplements controls associated with hazards in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes. The overall\n\npurpose of the PHA is to comply with the PSM/RMP Program regulations and to prevent or minimize the\n\neffects of a chemical release. The PHA team may conduct a new hazard analysis if significant modifications\n\nhave been made to the current process or new regulated processes are added. PHAs are, however, updated\n\nand revalidated at least every five years after completion of initial PHAs.\n\n\n\nThe program also ensures that the plant maintains up-to-date, accurate, written Operating Procedures that\n\nprovide clear instructions for all covered processes. Effective operating procedures, when combined with\n\noperator training, are instrumental in guaranteeing safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental\n\nreleases.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical integrity program is integral in preventing accidental chemical releases that may result from\n\nmechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment. This program outlines equipment maintenance\n\nprocedures, including maintenance, testing and inspection schedules and procedures, maintenance\n\npersonnel training, correction of equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance of new equipment.\n\n\n\nFinally, personnel training practices insure that all employees, including maintenance and contract\n\nemployees, working on or near the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process fully und"

In addition, the plant will train and certify new personnel and conduct mandatory refresher\n\ncourses for all personnel.\n\n\n\n4.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n40 CFR Part 68.90(b) states that the owner or operator of stationary sources whose employees will not\n\nrespond to accidental releases of regulated substance need not comply with section 68.95 of this part\n\nprovided that they meet the following: (1) For stationary sources with any regulated toxic substance held in a\n\nprocess above the threshold quantity, the stationary source is included in the community emergency\n\nresponse plan developed under 42 U.S. C. 11003;. Since the policy of the Town of Wytheville Wastewater Treatment\n\nPlant is to allow the emergency response teams organized by the Wythe County LEPC to respond to emergencies at the plant, the Town of Wytheville Wastewater Treatment Plant is not required to comply with 40 CFR Part 68.95, pertaining to the development and implementation of an emergency response program. However, the facility has developed the Town of Wytheville Emergency Response Procedure for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide which is issued to each employee at the WWTP.  It explains the actions to be taken in response to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  It includes procedures for emergency health care and contacts for the local agency responsible for responding to accidental releases.  The plan is coordinated with the local emergency response personnel."
