      "SummaryText": "John Taylor Fertilizers-Twin Cities facility is located in Elk Grove, California, approximately 15.5 miles south of the Sacramento Executive Airport off the I-5 freeway.\n\nThe facility has developed a Risk Management Program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785), and Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Plan requirements (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter 1, Part 68).  The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility staff is highly trained and utilizes log sheets and employee rounds to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia systems.  The facility?s policy is to implement reasonable standard operating procedures and maintenance tasks to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe anhydrous and aqueous ammonia are received, stored, and distributed directly to area farmers for the direct application as an agricultural nutrient.\n\n \nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per CalARP/EPA RMP regulations a worst case analysis has been defined for the anhydrous ammonia system and the aqueous ammonia system.  The meteorological conditions specified by Sacramento County and consistent with regulatory requirements for worst case scenarios were inputted"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.  The worst case release scenarios are highly unlikely to occur because of active and passive mitigation measures that are available and used, and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled for both of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program 2 substances: anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  The meteorological conditions specified by Sacramento County and consistent with regulatory requirements for alternative release scenarios were used.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distances for the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia scenarios.  The theory behind the CAMEO Evaporation Calculator was also used for the aqueous ammonia scenario.  The downwind distances for these alternative release scenarios are significantly less than that for the worst case scenarios.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook. \n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be hi"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  As ammonia is ?self alarming? due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.  \n\nThe Prevention Program 2 elements applied to the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia processes include:\n?Safety Information\n?Hazard Review\n?Operating Procedures\n?Training\n?Maintenance\n?Compliance Audits\n?Incident Investigation\n?Emergency Response\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no CalARP/EPA RMP applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in the past five years. \nThere have been no CalARP/EPA RM"
