Box 248  -   Shenandoah, IA  51601\n712-246-2474\nFor further information contact:  Steve Humphrey, Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n\nThe Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Farragut Ag Center are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility if prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 131,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of 3 semi trailer loads holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .6 miles.\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n"
