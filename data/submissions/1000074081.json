      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFACILITY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe primary activities at Arclin Toledo are the manufacture of formaldehyde and the production of specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is produced by processing methanol, which is delivered to the plant via rail car and tank truck.  The specialty resins are produced using formaldehyde and various other raw materials.  Finished products are shipped offsite in tanker trucks, drums and totes.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 53.5% by weight. \r\n\r\nAPPLICABILITY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe threshold quantity for formaldehyde is 15,000 pounds. The three identified processes at Arclin Toledo which are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program are the Formaldehyde Manufacturing process and the Resin Manufacturing process, which includes two resin reactors (K1 & K2).  \r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY POLICY OF ARCLIN USA, LLC\r\n\r\nArclin is committed to a clean, safe and healthy environment through the implementation of a management system dedicated to the prevention of pollution and continual improvement of our environmental, health and safety performance. We are committed to complying with applicable governmental laws and regulations and to meet the requirements of other organizations to which we subscribe. Our employees are our most important asset, and an integral part of the success of our environmental, health and safety programs.  We will properly train, equip, and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAll covered processes at Arclin are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Arclin's program elements have been expanded to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the complia"

      "SummaryText": "nce audit procedures required as part of Arclin's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\n3/11/2010: Arclin experienced a leak of formaldehyde inside of a containment dike that came from a storage tank. The quantity of material released was determined to be below the reportable quantity; however, as a precaution courtesy notifications were made to regulatory agencies pending quantification immediately after the release was discovered. There were no deaths/injuries on or off site as a result of this event, nor was there off-site property or environmental damage.  \r\n\r\n12/21/2012: The rupture disk on one of the resin reactors vented causing a quantity of in-process resin material to be released from the reactor. The resin deposited on trees, structures, vehicles, roadways and vegetation on Arclin property and neighboring properties. There were no injuries/deaths on or off site as a result of this event.\r\n\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nArclin Toledo has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde.  Arclin employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures"
