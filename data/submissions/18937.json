It is the intention of Davis Gas Processing management to provide safe and healthy working conditions and to establish and insist upon safe practices at all times by all employees. The prevention of accidents is an objective affecting all levels of our company and its operations. It is, therefore, a basic requirement that each supervisor make the safety of all employees an integral part of his or her regular management function. It is equally the duty of each employee to accept and follow established safety regulations and procedures. Every effort will be made to provide adequate training to employees. Employees are expected to assist management in accident prevention activities. Unsafe conditions must be reported immediately. Safety is everyone\u0012s business.\n\nSITE DESCRIPTION\nThe Claytonville DGP Plant is located at 5858 FM 1582, which is 7 miles SE of Pearsall, Tx. On FM 1582.\nThere is a Natural Gas Liquids Storage Tank, which is a 1,100 barrel painted, welded steel, above ground, horizontal pressure vessel. The  tank is protected by a pressure relief valve. Liquid flow into this tank is determined by the process operations. Liquid flow out of this tank goes to tank truck loading and is manually controlled. Operating personnel on a daily basis visually inspect this tank. If a spill occurred at this tank, the contents are so volatile that they would evaporate before penetrating the ground to any significant degree. \nThere is a Propane Storage tank, which is a 5,000 gal., painted, welded steel, above ground horizontal pressure vessel. The tank operates up to 200 psig. And is protected by a pressure relief valve. Liquid flow into this tank is determined by the process operations.

New and change in status employees have been trained when assigned to perform any duties that involve the handling of hazardous chemicals.  This facility has an Emergency Shut-Down Procedure that describes the steps to be taken in order for normal operations to be stopped and utility service to be cut off as personnel evacuate the premises during emergency situations.  The Foreman is responsible for accounting for all employees, personally or through a designee, by having all employees report to predetermined, designated rally point and conducting  a head count. Rescue and medical duties will be performed by EMS personnel from the Sweetwater, Texas Fire Department. The employees of the facility will be notified by verbal notification if  an evacuation is necessary.  All personnel have been trained in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of the premises.

The Propane Storage Tank contains 21,000 lbs. of flammable substance with a worst-case scenario radius of exposure of 1,056 feet. The Methanol Tank stores 33,600 lbs. of  flammable liquids and has a worst-case scenario radius of exposure of 1,584 feet. There are no houses or public facilities in the radius of exposure. \n.\nThis facility  has  had no accidents in the last 5 years involving a regulated chemical, that has involved death, injury, or emergency response. Our facility has procedures coordinated with the local response agencies encase of  an accidental release.\nThis facility follows the rules and regulations of  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency(EPA),  and the Texas Railroad Commission(TNRCC).This facility has labeled all their storage tanks with identifying signs and NFPA labels which enable the fire department easy identification of the products health, flammability, and reactivity.  By following these rules and regulation we are involved in an extensive training program for our employees. This facility  has an ongoing safety training program for their personnel. This program involves all the regulated training programs plus any on the job situations that our employees might encounter."
