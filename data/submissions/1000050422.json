      "SummaryText": "Morgan Energy Center (MEC) is a natural gas-fired combined-cycle cogeneration plant that is located in Decatur, Morgan County, Alabama.  MEC is capable of supplying steam to its host and generating a nominal capacity of 700 MW of electricity. The Plant consists of three combustion turbines equipped with heat recovery system (HRSG) and duct firing capability. The combustion turbine is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device that uses anhydrous ammonia for NOx emissions control.  The anhydrous ammonia tank, piping and associated equipment are addressed in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n\n\nMEC is subject to both the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68.10) and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119) since it exceeded the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, MEC is required to prepare an RMP and a PSM Plan. The requirements of both are essentially equivalent, therefore, this RMP will also serve as the facility PSM Plan. There are no other toxic or flammable substances on- site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia System Description\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in two dedicated, specially designed above ground storage tanks with an administrative policy and safeguards to not fill the tank beyond 85% capacity.  The anhydrous ammonia system is composed of five (5) major components: an unloading station, ammonia storage tank, ammonia vaporizer, ammonia flow control unit (AFCU) skid, and the SCR equipment.\n\nThe storage tank contains a mixture of liquid and vaporized ammonia under pressure. Ammonia saturation pressure in the tank varies as a function of ambient air temperature, and an ammonia vaporizer unit ensures that the correct pressure is maintained at all times. During periods of low ambient temperature, the pressure in the tank will drop to a minimum level at which point a vaporizer is used to maintain the temperature and thus the pressure in the tank. The ammonia storage ta"

      "SummaryText": "nk and vaporizer are located within a concrete containment. An ammonia supply line from the tank delivers the ammonia vapor through a pressure regulator to the ammonia supply header and then to the AFCU skid of the unit.\n\nThe AFCU skid consists of dual air blowers and inlet air filters, Ammonia/air-mixing chamber, air operated isolation valve, Ammonia flow regulating valve, flow element, and flow transmitter. The flow of ammonia into the HRSG is regulated by the Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) content in the combustion turbine exhaust gas stream, measured at points upstream and down stream of SCR Catalyst located within the HRSG. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPer the Program 3 requirements of the RMP and the PSM, MEC has implemented the following accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll MEC employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis. Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nMEC maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process technology, and process equipment. PSI data is updated when changes in the process occur. Information concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, and thermal and stability data.\n\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, maximum intended inventory information, safe u"

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety. The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMEC maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency  operations, normal operations and temporary operations. The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually. Safe work practices such as hot work, lockout and line breaking, are referenced in operating procedures, where applicable.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAll operations personnel of MEC are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process. Operations personnel will receive refresher training every three years.\n\nContractors\n\nMEC uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are pre-qualified before performing work, aware of th"

Calpine also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nMEC conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMEC has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure  vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures,(3) conducting maintenance training,(4) performing and documenting inspections,(5) correcting identified equipment  deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nMEC has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety. The hot work permit program is designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area.

The changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards  as well as to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMEC will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in,or could reasonably be expected to result in,the release of ammonia. The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors).\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, MEC will conduct a compliance audit every three years. The facility will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\n\n\nAdditional Safety Systems\n\nMEC has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of  accidental releases. These systems include:\n\n1. Redundant instrumentation to monitor critical process parameters\n\n2. Redundant critical equipment\n\n3. Automated  shutdown systems\n\n4. Pressure relief valves\n\n5.
