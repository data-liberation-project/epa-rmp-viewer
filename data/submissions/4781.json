The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nClinton Labs plays an active roll in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nClinton Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also host plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nClinton Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (BPM), on the north end of the plant, manufactures bulk drug substances for human health products.  BPM makes the intermediate form of these products and ships them to other sites for finishing into capsules or pediatric medications.  Animal Health, on the south end of the plant, manufactures feed additives and other animal health products.  These products are finished and packaged on site for worldwide delivery to customers.

The alternative release scenario involves a pipe from the tank being sheared, allowing the contents of the tank (88,000 pounds) to escape in 22 minutes.  According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) using typical weather conditions for the Clinton site, the distance to the toxic end point is 2.4 miles. Approximately 320 residents may be affected by this release. Administrative controls limit the amount stored in the tank to 88,000 pounds, approximately 52 percent of the tank capacity, to minimize the impact of a release.  Other systems in place to minimize the potential impact of this release include:  routine vessel inspections, proactive maintenance, alarms on critical tank parameters, remote emergency system shutdown stations, excess flow valves, experienced operators and a pre-start up hazards assessment.\n\nAlternative-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Bromine\n\nClinton Labs uses bromine in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  The alternative case release scenario for bromine involves a spill, scrubber failure, and fume transport system failure.  This would allow 21,000 pounds of bromine to be released in 120 minutes.  The vessel has secondary containment and automatic shut off valves. According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) using typical weather conditions for the Clinton site, the distance to the toxic end point is 2.0 miles.

The alternative case release scenario for chlorine involves multiple vessels leaking simultaneously. This would allow 40,000 pounds of chlorine to be released in 216 minutes.  According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) using typical weather conditions for the Clinton site, the distance to the toxic end point is 2.3 miles. Approximately 290 residents may be affected by this release. Systems in place to minimize the potential impact of this release include:  alarms on critical process parameters, tanks specifically designed for chlorine storage with recessed valves, experienced operators, and hazards assessment.\n\nAlternative-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Methyl chloroformate\n\nClinton Labs uses methyl chloroformate in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  The alternative case release scenario for methyl chloroformate involves a multiple vessel spill. This would allow 1,500 pounds of methyl chloroformate to be released in 108 minutes.  According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) using typical weather conditions for the Clinton site, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.2 miles.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nClinton Labs has experienced four minor accidents as defined by Title 40 CFR 68.42 in the five year period prior to June 21, 1999.  Following is a brief description of each accident:\n\nOn August 2, 1995, a charge hose was disconnected from a tanker truck unloading ammonia.  As a result of the disconnect, residual liquid ammonia in the hose vaporized and exposed an employee.  Less than one pound of ammonia was released.  This incident did not impact the community; however, a plant employee was exposed to the ammonia vapors.  The employee was subsequently checked by medical personnel and released.  As a result, administrative controls and procedures were improved.  Affected employees were made aware of this and trained as needed.  This incident is identified as AccidentHistoryID:  8.  An amount of one pound was entered in the RPM Submit data field 6.5(b) because the program will not accept values less than one pound. \n\nOn March 17, 1995, a release of less than one pound of bromine occurred when a hazardous waste line was being cleaned.
