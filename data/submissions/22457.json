Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Helena Chemical Company's Facility in Raymond, MN are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nIf such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Raymond Fire\nDepartment, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 12,500-gallon tank at our facility in Raymond (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 10,625 gallons (54,676.25 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (54,676.25 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and rural topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 7.5 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population "

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.43 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.43-mile radius of the\nfacility is 30.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHelena Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nHelena Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within\nour covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nHelena Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\nprocesses.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHelena Chemical Company conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\nensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Helena Chemical Company to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nHelena Chemical Company routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes\nand modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nHelena Chemical Company conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the\nplan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance\nissue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHelena Chemical Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention\nis a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5.
