As part of the manufacturing operations, aerosol propellants are transferred from storage tanks at the facility to individual product containers.  These chemicals are highly flammable substances that are carefully managed to minimize the risks of fire or explosion.\n\n\n\nThe chemicals (propellants) that are present at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantities are as follows:\n\n\n\nPropane/Butane (50/50 Mixture)     58,370 lbs.     Tanks No. 18, 19, and 26\n\nPropane/Butane (19/81 Mixture)     51,040 lbs.     Tanks No. 27 and 29\n\nDifluoroethylene                   15,100 lbs.     Tanks No. 16 and 17.\n\n\n\nThe covered process for AMREP, per Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule, is the transfer of the above listed propellents into product containers on three of the four production lines (Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri high speed rotary lines) located on AMREP's property.  The propellants are transfered via piping into three seperate gas rooms (one gas room services one of the above listed production lines) where the product containers are filled and then sealed before exiting the gas room.  The 50/50 Propane/Butane mixture is stored in one, bullet-style, 1,000-gallon above ground storage (AST) tanks and two, bullet-style, 5,500-gallon AST tanks.  The 19/81 Propane/Butane mixture is stored in two, bullet-style, 5,500-gallon AST tanks.  The difluoroethylene is stored in two, bullet-style, 1,000-gallon AST tanks.  The propellants in the above listed tanks are considered to be interconnected vessels, per RMP Rule, via the transfer piping and are considered to be a part of one covered process, which includes the tanks (listed above) and the associated transfer piping and gas rooms.  The process is considered to end once the product containers are sealed and leave the gas room.       \n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY "

      "SummaryText": "OF MAJOR HAZARDS\n\n\n\nAMREP uses three chemicals in its manuracturing process that are considered highly flammable under the RMP Rule.  These chemicals are transferred from storage tanks to production areas and placed in product containers.  The main hazards associated with the covered process are fire and explosion resulting from an accidental chemical (propellant) release. \n\n\n\n\n\nHOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\n\n\n\nAMREP maintains a comprehensive prevention program as required by the RMP Rule, with the objective of preventing accidental releases and other accidents from the covered process.  Access to the property and to individual areas of the facility is strictly controlled by an electronic security system.  An active explosion suppression system is installed in the gas rooms where the transfer of propellants to product containers occurs.\n\n\n\nSTEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS HAZARDS\n\n\n\nAMREP has implemented a Process Safety Management Program, as required by OSHA, that includes a systematic review of the hazards at the facility and a comprehensive management system to address the identified hazards and improve process safety.  This program is fully integrated with the prevention program under the RMP Rule, so that the hazard analysis, including off-site consequence analyses, encompasses accidental release prevention from the above mentioned covered process.  All of these efforts are conducted under the direction of the Safety Department, which includes top-level management personnel.  It should be noted, that AMREP updated the former propellant storage, handling , and transfer system in September 2011 from manual flex hose hook ups to a closed piping system that meets current NEPA, NEC and OSHA regulations.  The new system includes new 1,000 gallon bullet tanks to meet required pressure ratings and touch screen activation start and stop mechanisms.  The new system will prvide a safer way to handle the transfer of propellants and reduce the risk of a release.     \n\n\n\nRESPONSE ACTION"
