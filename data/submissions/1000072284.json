Like most refrigerated warehouse/production facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is the best refrigerate available for our use. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\n AdvancePierre Foods is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our associates and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environment Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) our priority is to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous material instead of merely responding to problems. \n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\n\n\n AdvancePierre Foods has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely and has developed programs, policies and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. We use the EPA's ammonia model ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate the hazard levels. (See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts, due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.) \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\n On July 19, 2020 one Team Member in the Refrigeration Department was changing a strainer on the roof and was sprayed in the face by Ammonia. \n\n  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\n AdvancePiere Foods utilizes an on-site Hazmat Team trained to respond and minimize a release  from the ammonia refrigeration system.

Our goal is and has been to be a responsible corporate citizen, protecting people and the environment. \n\n"
