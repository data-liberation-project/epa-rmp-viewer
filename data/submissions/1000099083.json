We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility. Our goal is to promote worker, public, and plant safety!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a full 5 year RMP submittal for the Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream facility, located at 3426 Wells Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana. We manufacture some of the finest packaged ice cream and ice cream snacks in the world. Some of the equipment in the facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials, warehousing, two ammonia refrigeration engine rooms (process and warehouse), refrigerated storage, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. Also located at the facility is raw milk processing equipment, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment equalization system. The facility produces and ships millions of pounds of products each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems required for our facility necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The process refrigeration system contains in excess of 46,719 pounds of anhydrous ammonia while the warehouse refrigeration system contains in excess of 27,016 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The site therefore has a total of 73,735 pounds of ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia to the atmosphere.

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected, employees are to notify the onsite Refrigeration Technicians, who are Hazmat Responders. The Hazmat Responder takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device. If the Hazmat Responder determines that the ammonia level is above 35 ppm, an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered. If an evacuation is necessary, an Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hazmat Responder and/or Incident Commander will determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed. If outside assistance is needed, the local HAZMAT organization is contacted and the internal Hazmat/Emergency Response Team is mobilized. \n\n\n\nThe Hazmat Responders then take appropriate action to mitigate the leak. They are trained in plant procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), to control the leak with appropriate personal protective devices in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream to remain an industry leader, especially in safety. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system.

The production facility incorporates a standard evaporation Evaporation and Compression Style Ammonia Refrigeration system. Ammonia vapor from the Intercoolers is routed to the suction inlet of the High Stage Compressors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the High Stage Compressors, ammonia vapor is compressed to a super heated vapor. The super heated vapor is fed to the Evaporative Condensers. At the Condensers the super heated vapor rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain. The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils. The condensers are equipped with Hydrostatic Relief valves that relieve around the isolation valves. Airflow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to each condenser.\n\n\n\n\n\nWater from the Condenser Water Sump is pumped via the Condenser Pumps to the Evaporative Condensers.

The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils. The condensers are equipped with Hydrostatic"
