      "SummaryText": "1.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\t\r\nUS Vanadium, LLC (US Vanadium), uses anhydrous ammonia (AA) as a reactant in the recovery of vanadium products, chlorine (Cl2), and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) in the halide manufacturing process. The AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 are regulated substances under the Accidental Release Program regulations, which governs the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule).  Certain safety precautions must be observed when handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to employees and nearby members of the community.  It is US Vanadium policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which these chemicals are handled, training of personnel who operate the processes, and the safety devices inherent in the design of the storage vessels. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program presents a logical, coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency.  The program utilizes information from the Emergency Response Guidebook by the Department of Transportation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.0  US VANADIUM AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nUS Vanadium includes a vanadium recovery process and a halides manufacturing process. Anhydrous ammonia is used to aid in the recovery of the vanadium product in a crystallization circuit. Chlorine is introduced into the vanadium halide production process as a reactant. Titanium tetrachloride is blended with vanadium oxytrichloride to form vanadium-titanium mixtures.  The AA, Cl2, and TiCI4 are the only chemicals that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list which are stored on site above threshold quantities. US Vanadium has no flammable substances regulated by the RMP Rule.  Storage conditions for the toxic chemicals r"

US Vanadium's Process Safety Management (PSM) program for AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 follows the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards (29 CFR 1910.119). Although the PSM program has been developed to follow the guidelines of the OSHA PSM standard, it should be noted that the US Vanadium facility is under the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).  The requirements for the prevention program take a proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of regulated substances that pose a danger to human health and the environment. This prevention program is a vital part of everyday operations at US Vanadium, as safety is the chief priority. The program employs high standards and includes the following steps and programs that lead to successful accident prevention. \r\n\r\n3.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nProcess safety includes information pertaining to the hazards of the substances in the covered processes as well as technology and equipment required for the processes. This information, updated regularly, helps to educate all employees on the current status of covered processes. The chemical hazards of"

Recommendations resulting from the PHA are promptly addressed following the completion of the review. Resolutions to the recommendations are performed and documented as soon as possible and a schedule for resolution of recommendations resulting from the PHA is developed and kept on-file in the PSM program. \r\n \r\n\r\n3.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe PSM program has documented procedures for each operating phase of US Vanadium's processes covered by the PSM program. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each department are kept on the server for electronic access. These SOPs are also readily accessible to employees. The SOPs are revised as needed as part of their ongoing review and reflect the most current operating practices of the covered processes. Included in the SOPs are practices for such operations as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, hot work permits, and safe work permits. The SOPs address elements for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. \r\n\r\n3.4  Training\r\n\r\nOperating and maintenance personnel at US Vanadium, as well as any contract employees, as required by the PSM regulation, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the developed operating procedures.

The Mechanical Integrity program for the US Vanadium facility is maintained and implemented by the Maintenance and Engineering Department. US Vanadium personnel completing inspection, maintenance, and preventive maintenance includes plant technicians, maintenance, and engineering personnel. A level of knowledge of mechanical and electrical equipment, process hazards, and safe work practices is required within the job description and within other elements of the PSM program.\r\n\r\nInspection and testing will be documented as described in the Mechanical Integrity program maintained by the Maintenance and Engineering Department.

A copy of the document is available electronically on the company server. This plan will be updated as necessary when modifications are made to the facility.\r\n\r\nUS Vanadium's Emergency Procedures Handbook provides information regarding the actions to be taken by employees in the event of an emergency and describes evacuation procedures and procedures for handling releases including small releases (e.g. use of B-Kit for chlorine leak). US Vanadium's Safety and Health Department is responsible for briefing employees once every year on the contents of the Emergency Procedures Handbook. A Security Committee is assigned to provide guidance and to carry out the procedures outlined in the Emergency Procedures Handbook.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan developed has been coordinated with the Garland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and local emergency responders.
