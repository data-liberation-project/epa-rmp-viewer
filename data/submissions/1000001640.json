The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of  Dalhart Consumers Fuel Association, Texline, TX location are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nA? The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nA? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production   nutrients.\nA? The maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in 1-30,000 gallon tank.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.68 miles.\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a line.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Amm"

      "SummaryText": "onia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History (either a or b)\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nA? Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\nA? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\nA? \n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n7. Planned Changed to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  In an effort to improve safety with the anhydrous ammonia storage at this site, we have reduced the total inventory to only one 30,000 gallon tank.  Even though this still represents the same worst case scenario under the Risk Management guidelines, it reduces the number of possibilities for releases from the other tanks. \n\nNo other specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations are scheduled at this time."
