Our KEEP management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitment of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through KEEP.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by the law.\n\nThe Tulsa Facility is one of many facilities operated by Koch Sulfur Products Company (Koch).  At the facility, we manufacture oleum and, from oleum, ultra pure sulfuric.  The ultra pure sulfuric acid manufactured at the facility is loaded into tank trucks for distribution.  Oleum is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Tulsa Facility.  There are no RMP-regulated flammable substances at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our sulfuric acid manufacturing operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 yea"

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals would be the loss of all of the oleum in our largest vessel.  In the case of the Tulsa Facility, this would involve our 100-ton oleum tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that the resulting release could cause off-site impacts would be 14 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown and others) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  The alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario which would involve an offsite impact, is calculated to reach approximately 4.5 miles from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict any potential release from such a scenario. Once again no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this alternative release scenario.  We selected the alternative scenario based on a release of oleum from the Oleum Still due to rupture of the sight glass.  We have mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  They include routine inspection and maintenance of the Oleum Still, thereby greatly reducing the possibility of such failure.  The presence of mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.  We have discussed these potential oleum releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Tulsa County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\nPrevention"

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n7 We have installed pH alarms to detect low pH wastewater in order to detect leakage of oleum.\n \n7 We have installed level indicators and high level alarms on all of our storage tanks and vessels.\n \n7 We have installed a SO2 monitor on our stacks in order to limit the SO2 concentration in the stack gases to 250 parts per million (ppm).  When the SO2 concentration exceeds 220 ppm, an alarm will sound which will enable the operator to take necessary corrective actions such as decreasing the amount of sulfur dioxide routed through the scrubbers.\n \n7 Our operators visually inspect equipment and take readings every hour.  Our facility is manned continuously on 24-hour basis.\n \n7 We have provided safety interlocks on sulfuric acid pump which will shutdown the pump when the pump discharge pressure is low.\n \n These safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since we acquired it in 1997.\n \n \n Five Year Accident History\n \n No incident having resulted in offsite impacts or onsite injuries from a RMP regulated substance has occurred at the Tulsa Facility within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n \n \n Emergency Response Program\n \n We will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coo"
