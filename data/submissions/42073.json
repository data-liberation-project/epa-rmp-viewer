The releases that HAT has had in the past 5 years are typically very small releases in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\nHAT has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control, and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.

All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nHAT is striving on a daily basis to make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.
