      "SummaryText": "A PSM, and the off-site consequence analysis does show a potential impact to the public under the required conditions of a worst-case release.\n\n6.  Use of Chemical.  Chlorine is used for disinfection of installation wastewater.\n\n7.  Use of Product and Product Turnaround.  A one-ton cylinder is used every 7 to 9 days.\n\n8.  How Chemical is Stored and in What Quantity.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers.  A maximum of four one-ton containers are stored onsite at any given time.\n\n9.  Description of Worst-Case Scenario and Alternatve-Release Scenario(s).  The worst-case release scenario for chlorine involves the EPA parameters of a 10-minute release of all material in a single container to the air.  No passive mitigation is assumed.  This scenario assumes that a one-ton container ruptures.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine would involve a valve failure at the container head and would give a leak rate of 15 pounds per minute.\n\n10.  General Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.  The chlorine at the USAGHI WWTP is an OSHA PSM covered process.  As such, the Risk Management Prevention Program will be maintained by the USAGHI Safety Office.  The Safety Office is responsible for meeting all applicable OSHA requirements.  \n\n11.  Five-Year Accident History.  The USAGHI has had no documented releases involving chlorine usage at the WWTP during the past 5 years.\n\n12.  Emergency Response Program.  The USAGHI receives fire and emergency service through an Interservice Support Agreement with the Department of the Navy and other Federal agencies.  The Deaprtment of the Navy is the lead agency, and its fire and emergency service is called the Federal Fire Department (FFD).  The FFD within the Schofield Barracks Community consists of three fire stations with 30-45 full-time responders.  The emergency response program will be operated and maintained by the FFD.  Because of the comprehensive operations of the FFD, no procedural changes are expected"

      "SummaryText": "1.  Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.  The USAGHI is committed to being a safe neighbor and employer.  Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations which have command support and visibility.  The USAGHI follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.\n\n2.  Primary Activities.  The USAGHI WWTP utilizes a conventional treatment process of primary clarification, biological treatment, secondary clarification, and chlorine disinfection.  Raw wastewater enters the plant and passes through a bar screen, a flow velocity grit chamber, and a parshall flume, before undergoing primary treatment in two circular settling tanks.  The wastewater then flows to six rectangular conventional activated sludge areation basins for biological treatment, after which it flows to the secondary clarifiers.  Following secondary clarification, the wastewater flows to one chlorine contact chamber.  Here the wastewater is thoroughly mixed with water into which gaseous chlorine had been injected.  The treated wastewater is then discharged and sent through a diversion ditch in order to be used by a local argricultural business for irrigation.  The capacity of the plant is 3.2 million gallons per day (MGD).  The average daily flow through the plant is between 2.7-2.9 MGD.  Approximately 200-400 pounds of chlorine are used per day.  The maximum rated capacity is 500 pounds per day for the chlorination process.  Chlorine is in excess of applicable Section 112(r) threshold quantities.  Chlorine gas is used at the plant for disinfection purposes.  \n\n3.  Reason the Process is Covered.  The process is covered because of the quantity of the chlorine which is potentially present onsite.\n\n4.  Quantity of Chemical.  Maximum potential of chlorine at the WWTP is 8,000 pounds.\n\n5.  Program Level of Chemical and Reason.  Chlorine will be treated as a Program Level 3 substance.  The WWTP operation is subject to OSH"
