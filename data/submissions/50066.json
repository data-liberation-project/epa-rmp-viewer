      "SummaryText": "a.  The City of Hays Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWT) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that\nintergrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The WWT emergency response policy involves the preparation of response\nplans which are tailored to the WWT and to the emergency response services available in the community; and is in compliance\nwith the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb. The WWT chlorination system has been installed to disinfect the flow of wastewater releases to Chetolah Creek and to the reuse of reclaimed water for irrigation purposes.  The chlorination station is located on the Old Highway 40 Bypass, approximately 1/2 of one mile east of the intersection of Vine Street and the Old Highway 40 Bypass.  The station inclues a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is five one ton containers.  Because the chlorinator building is located on the wastewater treatment site, the chlorinator building is normally unmanned, however; the wastewater treatment facility is manned 24 hours per day, seven day per week and periodic checks of the chlorinator building are made throughout the day. \n\nc. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operaor shall assume that the?maximum quantity in the largest vessell?is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\n\nEPA's RMP*COMP ? atmospheric dispersion m"

This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".  To determine the population within the impacted area local mobile home parks were contacted.\n\nActuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered.  An additional mitigation system installed is the conversion of the existing chlorinators to a remote vacuum type, with all pressurized chlorine gas piping replaced with vacuum piping.  This will reduce significally the amount of chlorine released in case of pigtail rupture.\n\nd. the general WWT accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n-High level of training of operators\n-Preventive maintenance program\n-Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipement\n-Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the WWT staff\n-Peformance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n-Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of respirators, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chorine detectors, written procedures for leaks and container changes\n\ne.

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  Emergency response plans and plan evaluations are conducted periodically; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed periodically.\n\nf. Two changes to improve safety (recommended action) were identified in April 2003, when a State of Kansas inspection was completed at the facility.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  The Hays WWT has updated its safety procedures as need arises and emergency procedures are all updated as necessary."
