The PSI program addresses the written requirements for chemical hazards by using Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  The MSDSs contain the required information regarding chemical toxicity, Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL), physical data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, reactivity data and the hazardous effects of incompatible mixtures.  In addition to the MSDSs, the refinery has Hazardous Material Warning Sheets (HMWS) prepared for each vessel in the refinery.  The HMWS is a one-page summary of the potental chemical hazards from the materials contained within the vessel.  The HMWS highlights the NFPA ratings, warning statements, immediate hazards, first aid treatment, symptoms of exposure and proper Personal Protective Equipment required.  In addition, the HMWS references the full MSDS.  \r\n\r\nThe chemical hazard data was originally compiled by the Industrial Hygienist (IH), who compiled the appropriate MSDSs and entered them into a database.  The IH is responsible for managing the currency and accuracy of the MSDSs.  New chemicals are added to the system through the Management of Change (MOC) process where several departments review the MSDS prior to its addition to the database and prior to the chemical's addition to the process area.

A scribe takes notes for the team during the PHA.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the primary PHA methodology used at the refinery is the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methodology.  The What-If and Checklist methodologies are used to supplement the HAZOP methodology when appropriate.  Complex processing units require the use of more detailed PHA methodology like HAZOP.  A HAZOP is a detailed review of the process in a systematic fashion to determine whether process deviations can lead to undesirable consequences.  Detailed Process Safety Information is required to perform a HAZOP, since the review process proceeds line-by-line through the processing unit.  The team lists potential causes and consequences of deviation as well as existing safeguards protecting against the deviation.  When the team finds that an inadequate protection exists for a credible deviation, then recommendations are developed to enhance safeguards.  The What-If methodology is a brainstorming approach about possible undesired events.  It is not as structured as the HAZOP, but allows for process safety concerns to be brought forward in a less rigid approach.  The Checklist methodology consists of a written list of items or procedural steps to verify the status of a system.

Once the occupancy load is determined, explosion, fire and toxic exposure analyses will be performed.  The explosion analysis involves the use of consequence modeling to identify any buildings that may be impacted beyond their generic overpressure response limit.  The fire analysis involves a comparison of the separation distance between each building and the nearest source of flammable material to determine if the occupants can safely evacuate the building.  The toxic analysis involves the use of dispersion modeling for Hydrogen Sulfide, Ammonia, Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, and determination of Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 3 (ERPG-3) levels.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team analyzes the PHA findings, risk ranks them and develops appropriate recommendations..  The priority ranking matrix evaluates the severity of the event coupled with its likelihood of occurrence.

The principal fuels produced are gasoline and diesel.  The refinery produces Propane and Butane for commercial purposes.  In addition, the refinery produces anhydrous Ammonia and elemental Sulfur for the agricultural market, as well as petroleum coke used for fuel in cogeneration plants in East Contra Costa County and overseas.  The refinery also supplies Carbon Dioxide to Air Liquide for the manufacture of dry ice.  The refinery accomplishes the production of these products from crude oil through the use of many complex processing units.  The refinery processes San Joaquin Valley Crude, Alaskan North Slope Crude and a large variety of other crudes.  San Joaquin Valley Crude is an example of a heavy oil, rich in sulfur and nitrogen.  Heavy oils must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons in order for it to be useable as motor fuels.  In addition, the sulfur and nitrogen must be removed from the oil distillates during processing to produce motor fuels that produce less smog upon combustion by cars and trucks.

It is then sent to the distillation tower where the hydrocarbons are heated and separated into fractions by molecular weight.  Lighter hydrocarbons have lower boiling points than heavier hydrocarbons.  The distillation tower produces six fractions:  wet gas/butanes, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, gas oil and resid.  The heaviest component, resid, is sent to the Feed Prep units for further distillation under vacuum.  After vacuum distillation,  the Feed Prep bottom product, which is made up of very heavy hydrocarbons and is solid at ambient temperature,  is sent to the Delayed Coker Unit (DCU).  The DCU thermally cracks large molecules  into smaller ones.  These smaller molecules can then be further processed into motor fuels.  The DCU also produces petroleum coke, which is black carbon powder.\r\n\r\nThe gas oil fractions from the Crude Units, the Feed Prep Units, and the Coker are still too heavy for use as motor fuels.  These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and/or the Hydrocracker Unit.  Both of these units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of a catalyst.  Catalytic cracking is more selective than thermal cracking.  The FCCU cracking breaks long chain hydrocarbons into short chains and multi-ring compounds into smaller ring compounds.  In addition, olefin compounds (unsaturated hydrocarbons) are generated.  Olefins are undesirable in motor fuels because they contribute to the formation of smog during engine combustion.  The olefins are removed by other process units.  The cracking process in the Hydrocracker occurs in the presence of Hydrogen gas.  Olefins and other unsaturated compounds are saturated during the hydrocracking process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds."

These units also saturate olefins.  The HDS units are particularly important for ensuring cleaner burning gasoline, since the removal of these compounds is critical to preventing smog from engine combustion of gasoline and diesel.  The Hydrodearomatization (HDA) unit removes aromatic compounds from diesel fractions, a necessary step in the production of producing cleaner burning fuels.  The Reformer rearranges hydrocarbons from straight chains into branched chains, rings and aromatics; these compounds are desirable because they raise the octane number of the motor fuels.  Aromatic compounds created by the Reforming units are saturated in the Benzene Saturation Unit, ensuring their removal from clean fuel production.  The Alkylation Unit combines two small molecules, a branched hydrocarbon and an olefin, to make a larger branched hydrocarbon.  This process generates alkylate, which is a high octane blending component in gasoline.  The Alkylation Unit uses Sulfuric Acid as a catalyst, which is an inherently safer alternative to Hydrofluoric Acid.  \r\n\r\nThe cracking processes produce very small hydrocarbons as well as the larger fractions discussed above.

The primary focus is on prevention of the occurrence of a scenario.  The following gives examples of safeguards designed for prevention of a potential hazard.  Safeguards protecting against excessive pressure include high pressure alarms, pressure safety valves, thermal relief valves, piping/flange/equipment pressure ratings, water separation facilities and safety valves.  Safeguards protecting against excessive temperature include high temperature alarms, manual shutdowns and automatic shutdowns.  Safeguards protecting against low temperature include insulation and heating.  Excessive flow is protected against by high flow alarms, fail to safe position control valves, and pressure safety valves.  Safeguards against low flow or no flow include low flow alarms, recycle streams, shutdown systems and check valves.  High and low levels are protected against by high and low level alarms and shutdown systems.  Safeguards against contamination include use of analyzers, check valves and standardized utility connections.  Prevention safeguards against explosions include furnace instrumentation.  Loss of containment is protected against by isolation valves, proper material selection for corrosion and temperature, avoidance of dead legs, periodic inspection, proper water draw and sampling facility design, locked valves, proper design of pipe bracing and vent locations, freeze protection, proper pipe r"

Many of the safeguards mentioned above are automatic safety systems that are commonly referred to as interlocks.  In addition, process areas vent to the refinery flare safety system, which safely burns the flammable material.  \r\n\r\nWhile the emphasis is on prevention of potential hazards, sometimes these events occur.  If this is the case, early detection is an important part of managing the event.  Examples of safeguards addressing detection of the occurrence of a potential scenario are discussed as follows.  Process and storage areas have leak detection systems for hydrocarbons, Hydrogen Sulfide and Ammonia.  Mitigation of an event is also an important part of managing the event.  Examples of safeguards addressing mitigation of potential scenarios are discussed as follows.  Safeguards to prevent escalation of incident include emergency block valves, depressurizing, equipment spacing, dikes, curbs and sewers, fire fighting access, hydrants, monitors, deluge systems, proper fireproofing of vessels, proper pipe supports and critical instrument controls.  As part of safeguarding against escalation of an event, the refinery has a comprehensive emergency response program.  Please refer to the emergency response section for a detailed discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgram 3 Prevention Program Elements\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nFederal, state and local regulations require the development of a written plan to address employee participation that includes consultation with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the Risk Management Program elements and provides employees and their representatives access to Risk Management Program information.  \r\n\r\nThe refinery has a written Employee Participation Plan that addresses all of the Risk Management Program elements.

All new processes and changes to processes must follow the Engineering Standards Manual; inspections and tests are performed for verification.  Redlined copies of P&IDs are placed in the control room prior to start-up.  All operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures changes must be addressed prior to unit start-up.  Employee training on the change typically takes place at safety meetings or one-on-one meetings with the supervisor.  In addition, control rooms have MOC binders for operators to read as part of the shift change routine.  If changes involve procedures, supervisors are responsible for ensuring that their employees are trained and understand the new procedure.  This may involve one-on-one discussions or practical demonstration.  PSSR records are retained with MOC records.  Any recommendations from the MOC/PSSR process are tracked through a database.  The Operations Supervisor verifies the completeness of the PSSR by field walkthrough and inspection and then authorizes the start-up.

These regulations also require that the last two compliance audit reports must be retained.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Compliance Audit Program is to determine the status and effectiveness of the Risk Management Programs established to meet the regulatory requirements of the Process Safety and Risk Management Regulations.  The Compliance Audit program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because the objective of the program is to assess existing Risk Management Programs and to find ways to improve the programs.  \r\n\r\nThe refinery has conducted Compliance Audits at least every three years since the implementation of OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  The two most recent audits were in 209 and 2012.  Each audit lasted approximately one week and reviewed all of the Risk Management Programs.  The Compliance Audit methodology utilized was a Tesoro Corporate checklist with is based on the Federal OSHA's Program Quality Verification (PQV) method and also includes OSHA's National Emphasis Program (NEP).  PQV method consists of evaluating the program, comparing the quality of the program with others in the industry and finally, verifying the implementation of each program.  PQV type audits are accomplished by conducting reviews of records, interviewing employees and conducting field observations.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audit team members are chosen based upon their knowledge and experience.  The final team will have members with knowledge and experience in refinery processing, regulatory requirements, and compliance auditing.

In addition, local regulations require the conduct of a Root Cause Analysis for all Major Chemical Accidents or Releases.\r\n\r\nThe refinery has an Incident Investigation program that establishes uniform procedures for reporting and investigating accidents and near misses at the refinery.  An incident is defined as an accident or near miss.  The program focuses on determining the facts surrounding the incident and formulating corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  The Incident Investigation program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because corrective actions are generated during investigations to prevent the incident from occurring again.\r\n\r\nThe Incident Investigation program classifies incidents into three categories, minor, serious and major (see classification in table below). Minor level incidents are investigated by an Area Supervisor using a causal factor approach to determine the cause of the incident.  Serious and major incidents are investigated by multi-disciplinary teams using Root Cause Analysis methodology.  \r\n\r\nIncident Classification\r\nMinor\r\nSerious\r\nMajor\r\n* Minor first aid injury\r\n* CWS Level 1\r\n* Minor process upset\r\n* Property damage/loss up to $250,000\r\n* Spill to surface water (up to 1 gallon)\r\n* Spill to ground (up to 3 barrels)\r\n* Three odor complaint"
