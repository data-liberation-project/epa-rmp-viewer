Chlorine is listed by EPA as a regulated substance.Since The Lebanon Water plant stores 8000 lbs of chlorine in 4-1 ton cyclinders it is required to deveope a RMP to reduce the risk to employees and the public.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.The water plant operators receive annual safety training.Contact with emergency responders is kept current.OFF SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS:No new structures have been built so there have been no changes have been made.The ACCIENDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:This program has not been changed since the process or equipment are the same.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:The CITY of Lebanon Water plant has an updated emergency response plan in effect.CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The City of Lebanon Water plant has added new leak dectectors,alarms,and automatic cyclinder cut offs since the 1999 rmp.James Arnold is still in charge of this program."
