This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tDescription of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of North Little Rock, Arkansas.  The facility is part of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility wastewater collection and treatment system.  The Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\r\n\r\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of the wastewater prior to releasing to the receiving stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\r\n\r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule requires the Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe results of this Hazard Assessment has been app"

The following details the prevention program elements at the Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\r\n\r\n4.1\tSafety Information\r\n\r\nThe Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered processes.\r\n\r\n4.2\tHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant has performed a Hazard Review of the chlorination process; an additional Hazard Review is scheduled to ensure the critical elements for safely storing and handling chlorine are in place in the process.\r\n\r\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant has experienced employees operating the chlorination process at the facility.  These operators have been certified as being knowledgeable in the procedures required to safely operate the chlorination process.  Written operating procedures are being prepared which will be used to:\r\n\r\n1. train employees and contractors, and\r\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during normal and abnormal process conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.4\tTraining\r\n\r\nThe Five Mile Creek Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.
