      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility is:  this facility complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Larry Wickman who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Larry will then decide what steps to be taken in the event of an emergency.   Our facility here in Mallard is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  This would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoints is 4.4 miles.  This includes an estimated 523 people within this radius.  Within the radius are schools, residences, recreation areas, and major commercial, office and industrial areas.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia plants is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with regulations and state law.  We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the Even of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Mallard Fire Dept and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with Gerald Lee the Palo Alto Disaster Coordinator and Mallard Fire Dept members.  The Mallard Fire Dept has inspected our NH# facility.  We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans.  We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
