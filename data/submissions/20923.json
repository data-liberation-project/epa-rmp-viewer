              "Description": "The Woonsocket  Wastewater Treatment Plant takes delivery of one ton cylinders of chlorine.  These cylinders are filled with 88% liquid chlorine and 12% gaseous chlorine. The cylinders are unloaded via a hoist and rail system that runs into the chlorine building\n\n\nInside the building six cylinders are placed on each of two banks of three cylinders . Cylinders are rotated on the banks  so the valves are vertically over each other. Each cylinder is connected from the top valve on the cylinder, NEVER THE BOTTOM VALVE  (the bottom valve will pull liquid chlorine and the top valve will pull gas from the cylinders) to a steel header line with three cylinders attached to each header via a whip ( special metal pipe connection).  The system up to this point is under pressure from the gas in the cylinders and any break in the system will release toxic chlorine into the room. The two vacuum regulators are connected by a  manifold into a AUTO/MANUAL switch over valve.  The maximum amount of chlorine gas that can be drawn off from one cylinder per day is about four hundred (400) pounds per day.  With three cylinders per feed system, you can draw off up to twelve hundred (1200) pounds per day. This limitation is due to the fact that as the liquid chlorine evaporates, it becomes colder and drawing more than 400 lbs. per day per cylinder (1200 lbs. total), you run the risk of freezing the lines.   If more than twelve hundred (1200) pounds are required the Hypochlorite system is turn on manually to help achieve the correct residual. Under normal conditions water from the chlorine ejector pumps pass through a Chlorine Ejector (a constriction in the line that creates a vacuum) in the chlorinator room. This vacuum is what pulls the chlorine from the Chlorinators and injects (dissolves) it into the water. Vacuum pressure to chlorinators should be 60 PSI or higher. Lower vacuum psi will mean that the chlorinator will not be able to pull enough chlorine to maximize its capacity. Chlorine Ejector pumps  are used to supply water to the Chlorine Ejector to create a vacuum to the Chlorinators. \nThe chlorinators control the flow of chlorine.  This can be done either \"Manually or Automatically.\" In Automatic mode the Chlorine Residual Analyzer tells the Chlorinator how much chlorine gas to allow through to maintain a set Chlorine Residual. The Chlorine Residual Analyzer has  high and low chlorine set points in the controller from either overdosing or under dosing chlorine based on residual. . This means if the Chlorine Analyzer fails, the chlorinator must be run manually.\nThere are a total of two (2) chlorinators.  Chlorinator #1 can be valved to be used either as the stand-by for the other chlorinators or for chlorinating the headwork's for odor control,  the Returned Activated Sludge (RAS), Gravity Thickeners (GT), and Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) line. Chlorination of the RAS is generally used for control of filamentous bacteria.  There is a single line from the chlorinator that splits into two lines in the Gravity thickener building. These valves can be opened or closed to divert the chlorine to either the WAS line or for masking the Gravity Thickener. To send chlorine to both the WAS and the GT the valves must be  opened in the Gravity Thickener.",

              "Description": "The Woonsocket  Wastewater Treatment Plant takes delivery of one ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide.  These cylinders are filled with 88% liquid sulfur dioxide and 12% gaseous sulfur dioxide. The cylinders are unloaded via a hoist and rail system that runs into the chlorine building\n\n\nInside the building two cylinders are placed on each of two banks. . Cylinders are rotated on the banks  so the valves are vertically over each other. Each cylinder is connected from the top valve on the cylinder, NEVER THE BOTTOM VALVE  (the bottom valve will pull liquid sulfur dioxide and the top valve will pull gas from the cylinders) to a steel header line with two cylinders attached to each header via a whip ( special metal pipe connection).  The system up to this point is under pressure from the gas in the cylinders and any break in the system will release toxic sulfur dioxide into the room. The two vacuum regulators are connected by a  manifold into a AUTO/MANUAL switch over valve.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide gas that can be drawn off from one cylinder per day is about four hundred (400) pounds per day.  With two cylinders per feed system, you can draw off up to eight hundred (800) pounds per day. This limitation is due to the fact that as the liquid sulfur dioxide evaporates, it becomes colder and drawing more than 400 lbs. per day per cylinder (800 lbs. total), you run the risk of freezing the lines.   Under normal conditions water from the sulfure ejector pumps pass through a sulfur Ejector (a constriction in the line that creates a vacuum) in the sulfurnator room. This vacuum is what pulls the sulfur dioxide from the sulfornator and injects (dissolves) it into the water. Vacuum pressure to sulfurnator should be 60 PSI or higher. Lower vacuum psi will mean that the sulfurnator will not be able to pull enough sulfur dioxide to maximize its capacity. Sulfur Ejector pumps  are used to supply water to the Sulfur Ejector to create a vacuum to the sulfurnator\nThe sulfurnators control the flow of sulfur dioxide.  This can be done either \"Manually or Automatically.\" In Automatic mode the Sulfur dioxide Residual Analyzer tells the Sulfurnator how much sulfur dioxide gas to allow through to maintain a set Sulfur dioxide Residual. The Sulfur dioxide Residual Analyzer has high and low sulfur dioxide set points in the controller from either overdosing or under dosing sulfur dioxide based on residual. . This means if the Sulfur dioxide Analyzer fails, the sulfurnator must be run manually.",

      "SummaryText": "\nThe Woonsocket Regional Wastewater Commission's (WRWC) Accidental Release\nPrevention Policy involves a unified approach that integrates state of the art technologies,\nprocedures and management practices.\n\nFor process ID 1 (Chlorination),  the WRWC utilizes chlorine in its clarification process in order\nto meet its Permit limit of fecal coliform.  The Chlorination System consists of  two (2) banks\nwith three (3) one toncylinders of chlorine each.  There is an automatic switch valve to switch\nover when onebank is empty.  Each chlorine cylinder is equipped with a rapid shut off valve.  This\nsystem provides a rapid closure (3 second response) of chlorine cylinders upon contact closure\nfrom gas detectors and fire alarm.  To make the system safer, a second chlorine gas detector\nwas installed and connected to the cylinders rapid shut off valves controller as a back up in\nthe event of failure of the main chlorine gas detector.  In addition a motorized shut off\nvalve was installed on each chlorine line to the vacuum regulators.  Those valves will be\nactivated upon receiving a signal from the PLC in the event that the chlorine gas detectors\nor the fire alarm are activated.  Total response time from the time of release to complete\nshut down of system is seventeen (17) seconds.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios,\nidentified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined\nby EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum\nquantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified\nfailure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case\nrelease scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled\nby the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected\nby EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Plann"

This conditions was pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as\na gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint and\nconsideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to\nthe toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the\noffsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case scenario was performed using\nthe EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles and an estimate of\nresidential population potentially affected of 28,000 was obtained. \nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails)\nconnected to three ton-containers, possibly due to an earthquake.  The amount of chlorine\nreleased is 1 lbs., at an average rate over one minute (the duration of the release) of 1 (one)\nlb/min. The estimated toxic endpoint was 0.10 mile with 30 persons effected.
