Our key products include materials used in the manufacture of naproxen sodium, naproxen, and other pharmaceuticals.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBromine and methyl chloride are two of the primary chemicals used in the manufacture 2-bromo-6-methoxynaphthalene (BMN) and 1-bromopropionic acid (BPA), materials used in the manufacture of the pharmaceuticals naproxen and naproxen sodium.  The RMP Threshold Quantities are 10,000 lbs. for both bromine and methyl chloride.\n\nPhosphorous trichloride is used as a catalyst in the manufacturing of BPA.  The RMP Threshold Quantity for PCl3 is 15,000 lb.\n\nChloroform is used as a solvent in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product for treatment of Hepatitus B.  The RMP Threshold Quantity for Chloroform is 20,000 lb.\n\nHydrogen Chloride (anhydrous) is used as a reactant in the manufacture of Gabapentin-4, a precursor to the drug neurontin.  The RMP Threshold Quantity for anhydrous HCL is 5,000 lb.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION-METHYL CHLORIDE\n\nMethyl chloride is a material used in the BMN manufacturing process.  Methyl chloride is unloaded from a tank truck to a 12,000 gallon carbon steel tank.  It is stored under pressure as a liquid (pressurized gas). When used in the process, liquid methyl chloride is pumped from the storage tank  through a flow meter to the processing tanks. The carbon steel storage tank contains up to 74,000 pounds of methyl chloride.  The average daily amount on site is approximately 40,000 to 50,000 pounds.\n\nThe methyl chloride storage and handling system is closely monitored and protected: All safety parameters for the methyl chloride system, including tank and system integrity are monitored using control system software and displayed on computer terminals in site control rooms. Automatic shutdown controls are engaged in the event that process parameters go outside of predetermined setpoints.  \n\nA sp"

      "SummaryText": "rinkler system is installed to ensure that the tank is properly protected from fire impingement. \n\nMethyl chloride sensors have been installed around the tank to detect potential methyl chloride leaks.  If a sensor detects methyl chloride, it activates the emergency shutdown system which isolates the tank in a safe shutdown mode.\n\nDuring methyl chloride unloading,  process parameters are constantly monitored by employees using control system software; the process parameters are displayed on computer terminals in site control rooms.  Additionally, video cameras provide the ability to visually monitor the unloading process from the control room.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION-BROMINE\n\nBromine is used in the manufacture of both BPA and BMN.  Due to interconnectivity with Bromine Storage, BPA and BMN manufacturing are considered a single process as defined by the Risk Management Program Rule.\n\nAll of the liquid bromine on site is stored in an indoor containment room equipped with containment dike walls and process control systems to prevent upset conditions.  Bromine is received on site via a tank truck.  The tank truck is parked in an enclosed unloading bay where bromine is unloaded from the trailer to storage tanks. The average daily amount on site is approximately 157,500 pounds stored after a bromine truck is unloaded.  The bromine unloading and storage rooms are equipped with bromine leak detectors which initiate an alarm in the event of a leak.\n\nAny leak or potential release of bromine is limited and quickly mitigated by management practices as well as several safety devices (interlocks) incorporated into the bromine storage and transfer system:\n\nAll bromine in storage and loading is handled within a containment vault to contain any potential releases.  \n\nBromine is stored indoors, thus significantly reducing the potential for an off-site release. Room ventilation is exhausted through a scrubber to remove bromine from the discharged air.\n\nAll"

      "SummaryText": "unloading transfers from tank trucks to storage tanks are monitored by unloading crew members. Unloading crew members constantly oversee the bromine unloading procedure from the unloading room's control panel.  Unloading process parameters are monitored using control software and displayed on computer terminals in site control rooms.  Additionally, video cameras provide the ability to visually monitor the unloading bay during the process.   Bromine transfers from storage tanks to the process vessels are also monitored by the control system and displayed on terminals in plant control rooms.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION-PHOSPHOROUS TRICHLORIDE\n\nPhosphorous trichloride is used as a catalyst in the manufacturing of BPA.  The maximum intended inventory for PCl3 in this process is only 3900 lb, which is below the RMP Threshold Quantity as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.130.  Therefore phosphorous trichloride is not listed as a covered-chemical for the BPA \\ BMN process.  Note, however, that the BPA \\ BMN process is covered for Bromine and Methyl Chloride, and Program 3 elements are applied.\n\nPhosphorous trichloride is received in drums and is stored in a dedicated warehouse.  Only water-reactive chemicals are contained in the facility.  Sprinkler piping in the warehouse is plugged to reduce the risk of introducing water.  It is segregated from all processing facilities, offices, and other high-traffic / high-population areas.  All electrical equipment in the facility is classified Class 1, Div 2, Group C/D or higher.  The flooring in the warehouse is designed to contain any spills within the structure.  The maximum intended inventory of PCl3 in the facility is 55,000 lb.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION-CHLOROFORM\n\nChloroform is used as a solvent in the manufacturing of a pharmaceutical product.

The containment dike is equipped with a foam suppression system to extinguish a fire and/or reduce the vapors emitted from a large spill.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION-HCl\n\nAnhydrous Hydrogen Chloride is used as a reactant in the manufacture of Gabapentin-4, a pharmaceutical intermediate.  The HCl is stored on-site within the tube trailer used to ship the material.  Each trailer contains seven (7) cylinders, each containing 3000 lb of HCl at approximately 600 psi when full.  Up to 2 tube trailers, or 42,000 lb of HCl, may be present on site at a time.  The HCl tube trailers are staged with the rear half (including all manifolds, valves, etc.) of the trailer semi-enclosed in one of two three-sided structures.  The connection/disconnection process is conducted within each enclosure.  Each staging area is equipped with an HCl detector interlocked with an automated valve on the HCl supply piping and a water curtain across the fourth side the enclosure.

The worst case release scenario results in off-site Hydrogen Chloride concentrations at or above the EPA Level of Concern (LOC) concentration of 0.030 mg/L up to 2.2 miles from the point of the release.  At the LOC concentration, most individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects that could impair their abilities to take protective actions.  See Section 2 of the RMP Submit report for detailed information on this release scenario.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nIn accordance with the RMP program, alternative release scenarios were evaluated for methyl chloride, bromine, phosphorous trichloride, chloroform, and hydrogen chloride.  Alternative releases are intended to be more likely than the worst case scenarios.  These scenarios assume average atmospheric conditions and allow for the reasonable application of safety systems and facility response.  Each process is evaluated to consider what type of accidents or equipment failures might occur, and what off-site consequences might result.\n\nMethyl Chloride: The alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is a release through the emergency pressure relief system on the 12,000 gallon storage tank due to over-pressurization.  The release was assumed to continue for 60 minutes.  \n\nThis alternative release scenario for methyl chloride results in off site methyl chloride concentrations at or above the EPA Level of Concern up to 0.14 miles from the storage tank.

Additionally, there are four methyl chloride sensors installed at strategic locations on the tank to detect leaks.  Once the sensor detects a leak, it activates the emergency shutdown system which isolates the tank and maintains the methyl chloride within safe operating parameters.\n\nBromine: The alternative release scenario for bromine involves the release of bromine from one of the transfer lines that transports the bromine from the storage area to the manufacturing equipment.  A failure of a flange or gasket in this piping could result in a release.  Clariant LSM assumes that the leak could continue unabated for 15 minutes, forming a pool inside a production building which gradually evaporates resulting in an off-site release.  This alternative release scenario for bromine results in an off site bromine concentration at or above the EPA Level of Concern for up to 0.10 miles.  At the Level of Concern concentration, most individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects that could impair their abilities to take protective actions.\n\nAll bromine transfer piping for the BMN and BPA manufacturing process are located indoors.  Bromine lines are high integrity piping that is in compliance with Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices and are installed per Clariant LSM (Missouri) Inc.'s  Pipe Specifications which conform to ASME Process Plant Piping Code (B31-3).  In addition to installing high integrity lines for all bromine transfers, the flanged connections are all equipped with flange guards.

The spill was assumed to spread to a thickness of 1 cm.  \n\nThis release scenario results in an off site PCl3 concentration at or above the EPA Level of Concern for up to 0.09 miles (151 yards).  At the Level of Concern concentration, most individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their abilities to take protective action.\n\nPhosphorous trichloride is stored in 55-gallon drums in an enclosed warehouse dedicated to water-reactive materials.  Drums are strapped to the fork truck during transportation to prevent tipping and potential rupture of drum.  All traffic areas are paved and the site topography prevents any spilled liquids from contaminating soil, groundwater, etc.  Emergency response personnel are well-trained in handling spills of materials.\n\nChloroform: The alternative release scenario for chloroform involves the overfilling of the storage tank.  The scenario assumes a failure in the level transmitter in the tank, resulting in a spill of 200 gal.  \n\nThis release scenario results in an off site Chloroform concentration at or above the EPA Level of Concern for up to 0.05 miles (81 yards).

The tank is positioned in a containment dike with sufficient volume to contain the contents of the tank.  The containment dike is equipped with a foam suppression system to extinguish a fire and/or reduce the vapors emitted from a large spill.\n\nHydrogen Chloride: The alternative release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is rupture of a 1\" line or hose immediately downstream of the pressure regulator (30 psig supply).  The leak would continue unabated for a very short period of time before HCl detectors would alarm and automatically close an automated supply valve and a water curtain would activate at the opening of the enclosure.  A conservative estimate of 5 minutes was used for the release duration.  Note: an excess flow valve is also present in the system and would activate almost immediately, severely restricting flow. \n\nThe release rate was calculated using the EPA's Risk Management Program OCA Guidance equation (11).  From this equation, the release rate is 29.23 lb/min.  This value was used in the ALOHA program for determining the distance to toxic endpoint.
