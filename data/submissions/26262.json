Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Moorhead Cooperative, Moorhead, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the site is the storage for sale to farmers of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients. Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in 1 - 18,000 gallon storage tank and 28 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The total maximum quantity stored would be about 201,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios: a) The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest single storage tank, 18,000 gallons, over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be about 78,800 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, ppm) is estimated to be about 1.8 miles. b) The alternate case scenario, based on the five year accident history or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is estimated to be about 1.2 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administr"

      "SummaryText": "ation (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-\"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor, to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, peoperty damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has: a) a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 191038, and b) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
