This site is located in Goliad County between Victoria and Fannin, Texas.  The facility has 80 full time employees.\n\nAEP Texas Central Company is an investor-owned utility supplying electric service based in South Texas.  The company's common stock is held by American Electric Power Company, Inc., a registered public holding company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.  On June 15, 2000 AEP merged with Central and South West Corporation (CSW), the former parent company of Central Power and Light (CPL).  American Electric Power owns and operates more than 42,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the United States and select international markets and is the largest electricity generator in the U.S. AEP is also one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, with more than 5 million customers linked to AEP\u00bfs 11-state electricity transmission and distribution grid. \n\nThe facility is a one-unit power generation facility with a total generation of 632 mw.  It burns coal as the primary fuel with fuel oil as the startup fuel.  The General Electric turbine generator and Combustion Engineering boiler was installed in 1980.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) five year re-certification that was prepared for the AEP Texas Central Company Coleto Creek Power Station located outsite of Fannin, TX.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  There has not been an accidental release at the facility over the past five years.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case o"

      "SummaryText": "r more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Coleto Creek Power Station has been producing electricity for more than 20 years.  During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surrouding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario, are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community, based upon extreme conditions, defined by the EPA.  A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from EPA's RMP*Comp software.  It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational for this theoretical excerice.  However, the laws of physical science do not allow a complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed.  These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenarios may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nTCC's chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases.  Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the plant include:\n- Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineering requirements.\n- Automatic shut-off devices\n- Interlocks and relief valves\n- Specifically designed pressure gauges, fittings, connections, tubing and piping.\n\nPlant personnel whose responsibilities"

Repairs are required on all items identified as defective during inspections.\n\nTCC has an established Preventative Maintenance Procedure specifically developed for the chlorination system.  This procedure requires:\n- Periodic inspection and testing of all mechanical systems\n- Detailed documentation of all inspection and maintenance activity\n- Documentation of equipment deficiencies\n- Timely and appropriate repair of all deficiencies.\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) system has been specifically developed for the chlorination system at this plant in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Process Safety Manangement rule.  This management system includes:\n- An initial and periodic analysis of engineering and administrative controls\n- Investigation procedures designed to resolve and correct potential incidents\n- Formal audits performed by trained individuals with knowledge of chlorination systems.\n\nIf a release occurs, only trained Emergency Response Personnel will respond to assess and stop the leak.  In all cases, necessary actions will be taken to control the release of chlorine.\n- The Plant Control Room will be notified immediately if a chlorine leak is detected.\n- Control Room personnel will coordinate emergency response procedures.\n- Emergency response procedures may include:\n- Notification of authorities\n- Evacuation of plant personnel\n- Evacuation of public.\n- Notification of plant and/or company manager"
