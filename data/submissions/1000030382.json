The facility is a research and development (R&D) operation responsible for developing hydrogen fuel cell technology for GM. The location houses over three hundred and fifty full time employees.\n\n\n\nFuel cell processes use hydrogen; a flammable substance subject to Federal regulation. There are three (3) liquid hydrogen storage tank systems designed to supply fuel to the facilities' fully functional testing equipment. The storage tank systems are leased from a hydrogen supplier. The supplier is responsible for routinely filling the tanks and maintaining the bulk storage systems. The supplier's systems deliver hydrogen to the building (s) and this material is distributed through facility infrastructure and piping to a series of test stands. Only properly trained and qualified people are allowed to work on the storage tank systems or the piping systems.\n\n\n\nThe test stands provide hydrogen to a fuel cell stack or module in a manner that emulates the electrical and fluidic interfaces of a vehicle. The process is intended to simulate the dynamic operation of a fuel cell vehicle and is used to perform long-term fuel cell system life testing. Venting to combustible exhaust is done to depressurize the system for maintenance and to allow the system to be purged with an inert gas. The system is comprised of stainless steel tubing and fittings as well as manual and automated control valves, regulators and filters.  A comprehensive analysis of the effects of potential system failures is in place and redundant process control systems have been implemented to mitigate potential risk. In addition, the facility has a robust management of change process that requires safety reviews for system modifications and alterations.\n\n\n\nProcess variables such as flow, temperature and pressure are continuously monitored.  Process information is monitored by a computer-based control system that also "

In the event of a gas detection alarm, the system will automatically stop the gas flow through the module and associated test stands.  Alarm limits are established using safety factors well below dangerous condition thresholds. Manual emergency stop capabilities are located throughout the site as well. The facility maintains twenty four (24) hour, seven (7) day per week security coverage in addition to surveillance systems. The Facility has coordinated emergency response actions with the local fire department.  The employees at the Facility will not respond to accidental releases of hydrogen when safety of the employees is at risk. \n\n \n\nBased on the current state of technology associated with operating and monitoring the process, there are no current planned changes to improve safety beyond the corrective and preventive actions as part of the process hazard analysis\n\n    \n\nGM has not experienced any accidental releases in the past five years that are subject to reporting under the RMP regulation.\n\n"
