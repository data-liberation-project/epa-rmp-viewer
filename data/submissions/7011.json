The City of Salisbury Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has developed an Emergency\n     Response Plan which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety\n     Management standard and the US EPA's Emergency Response Program.  The plan\n     provides employees guidance on what to do in case of a chemical discharge emergency.  It\n     is used by the WWTP when training and preparing for a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide\n     leak.  The Salisbury WWTP has a very strict overall approach to chemical safety.  All of\n     our employees and our Hazmat team are annually trained to respond to a chemical\n     emergency reminding them that safety is the most important element when protecting\n     themselves and the community.\n\n     b.   The City of Salisbury WWTP is responsible for the treatment of the wastewater within the \n     boundaries of the city and additional annexed areas of approximately 12.88 square miles in\n     size.  The wastewater plant treats approximately 5 million gallons per day of wastewater\n     and maintains 151.07 miles of interceptor collection lines.  The WWTP is located at 1142\n     Marine Road in Salisbury, MD.  The Wicomico River runs behind our facility where we\n     discharge our effluent.  The WWTP uses chlorine primarily for disinfection and sulfur\n     dioxide for dechlorination.  These chemicals are stored in 1-ton cylinders that are housed\n     in one main building.  The building also holds chlorinators/sulfonators, electric panels and\n     safety equipment.  The maximum amounts of chlorine and sulfur dioxide handled are\n     24,000 lbs. (12 1-ton cylinders) each.\n\n     c.   The City of Salisbury WWTP has prepared an offsite consequence analysis for chlorine\n     and sulfur dioxide releases including a worst-case scenario and an alternative release\n     scenario.  The results are as follows:"
