As a manufacturer of aluminum ingots its products are sold globally under its corporate company, Connell, Ltd, 1 International Place, Fort Hill Square, Boston Massachusetts.\n\tThe facility is located in Wabash, Indiana.  The Wabash Alloys facility is located at 4525 W Old Highway 24, Wabash, Indiana 46992.  The site is approximately 73 acres in size.  The site is serviced with electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer lines.  \nOperation Description\nChlorine\n\tThe site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a maseparation process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n\tThe sorted aluminum is charged into one of four furnaces where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-site for the process are aluminum, magnesium, zinc, copper, silicon, sodium, beryllium, and strontium.  Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at any given time.\n\tOnce the molten product is prepared, the melt is either poured and cooled as ingots or sows, or is transferred to heated crucibles for shipment as a molten material.  Particulate emissions from the crusher are controlled with a baghouse.  The emissions from the dryer are treated first using a secondary combustion unit, and then with a baghouse.

Also, as the operator of a facility at which substances may be used that in uncontrolled situations could cause harm to the public and damage to the environment, we will strive for environmental excellence with a commitment to continual improvement, pollution prevention and compliance with legislative requirements.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) is one of these programs.\n     Each employee in areas where the RMP is applicable will be knowledgeable of the related policies and procedures and the supervisors or a designated person is required to insure that they understand them.  Employees and supervisors are required to comply with our policies and are subject to corrective action in those cases determined to indicate willful violation.\n\tA written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program has been developed as a part of our Release Prevention Program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119.

The tanker is connected into piping through which chlorine as a liquid flows to a vaporizer at a pressure of 150 psi. \n     The vaporizer heats the chlorine to the vapor state by a recirculated hot water electric heater, which is thermostatically controlled.  Chlorine gas exits the vaporizer through a regulator and into a piping manifold.  Each furnace has its own chlorine supply pipe and flowmeter, which regulates the pressure.\n     At each particular furnace the chlorine gas passes a shut off valve, then through another flowmeter, and then through a needle valve where its flow is regulated by the furnace operator to the molten metal pump.  Close to the needle valve is the tubing connection that connects to a carbon lance, which feeds the gas to the pump housing.  Here the chlorine reacts with magnesium and aluminum to demag and clean the aluminum alloy.\nPropane\n\tPropane is stored in a 13,000 gallon tank on the east side of the facility.  Transferred through piping over the building, the gas is pumped to two 1,000 gallon tanks at a fueling station.  The fuel is used for fueling industrial trucks.\nWorst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\nChlorine\n\tAs a part of the Wabash Alloys proactive program concerning the hazards of chlorine to its' workers and the surrounding public, its staff has conducted a thorough hazard assessment.\n\tFor the hazard assessment and the RMP, populations potentially affected are defined as those within a circle that has as its center the point of release and its radius the distance to the toxic or flammable endpoint.
