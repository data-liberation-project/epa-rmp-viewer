      "SummaryText": "RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nNatural Selection Foods utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  The equipment is reviewed by onsite personnel, and certified refrigeration contractors as required.\n\nInitial emergency response is provided by onsite personnel.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel. Emergency response for a major release event will be provided by local fire and police departments with mutual aide response. The refrigeration contractor would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Natural Selection Foods facility is located at 1721 San Juan Highway in San Juan Bautista, California. This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their precooling, cold rooms and process water chilling operations. Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat.  The produce is then stored in a cold storage warehouse.\nThe equipment for warehouse cooling consists of portable and permanently installed equipment. The main refrigeration system configuration includes: two Low Pressure Recirculating unit with ammonia pumps, cold room evaporators, various safety equipment including two refrigerant discharge diffusion tanks, four compressors with "

The facility implemented the State and County mandated emergency response plan (AKA Business Response Plan), which outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release response as well as general facility response.\n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nAdditional risk reduction measures may be implemented to further reduce the potential for an accidental release.
