The company?s management maintains an active role in ensuring that environmental compliance takes place through an active review of its safety and environmental plans. A pro-active approach has been adopted through establishing a preventive approach to chemical safety. The preventive program addresses employee participation and training, process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity reviews, compliance audits, and change management.\n\nThe facility, which utilizes 118,000 square feet, is located on highway 61 South in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The company employs 68 people and operates year round. The primary products consist of polystyrene egg cartons, food and serving trays. Polystyrene crystals are extruded to make rolls of polystyrene, which is subsequently formed using various molds and dies in thermoforming machines. Pentane, an EPA regulated substance, is used to expand the polystyrene crystals. The maximum amount stored at the facility is 34,000 lbs. \n\nThe worst-case scenario would consist of the release of 34,000-lbs. of Pentane stored in an external tank. The off site impact could consist of the formation of an explosive vapor cloud. Should the cloud ignite an explosion could occur. The distance to the endpoint has been estimated at .2 miles from the source. Control mechanisms such as pressure switches are in place to limit any potential release. \n\nThe most likely or alternative release would be 10 lbs., which would result in a cracked pipe, broken pipefitting or through human error. Such leaks would occur inside the facility and could create an explosion hazard or danger of fire. The company utilizes perimeter monitors to detect gas leaks, process area detectors, in-line pressure switches and sprinkler systems to mitigate the chance of an internal release.\n\nThe operation at Foam Packaging complies with OSHA-PSM rule.

For example, the processes operating procedures have been defined and documented for startup, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdowns. Employee training is an on going process to ensure that those individuals who are a part of the covered process understand the hazards and appropriate responses. An inspection program is in place to test the mechanical integrity of the covered process. The program consists of visual and mechanical verification of the components to ensure their operation. \n\nDuring the past five years the company has not experienced any release of Pentane.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency response system in conjunction with the Vicksburg Emergency Management Center and the city fire department. The plan has a system of internal and external notification should a release occur. Listed are the appropriate contacts depending on the severity of the release. The system also provides a procedure for employee evacuation. Periodic dills are conducted to test the evacuation system."
