      "SummaryText": "A.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFlexible Foam Incorporated is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in High Point, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (10,000 pounds).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations. \n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n \nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Flexible Foam\n\nFlexible Foam is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.\n? One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case scenario was conducted for TDI.\n? One alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternat"

The hazard review identified the hazards associated with the regulated substance in the TDI process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.  Any issues identified during the hazard review were documented and will be resolved in a timely manner.  The hazard review will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial hazard review.\n\nOperating Procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for each covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.52.  Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including initial system startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and conditions when required, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures also incorporate or reference relevant process safety information including the following:\n? Process Operating Limits (including consequences of deviations and steps to correct or avoid such deviations).\n? Safety and health considerations (including properties and hazards of covered chemicals, precautions necessary to prevent exposure, control measures to be taken upon physical contact or airborne exposure, quality control for raw materials, and control of regulated substance inventories).\n?
