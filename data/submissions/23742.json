Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners of Carson Grain are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If a release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local authorities to mitigate and minimixe the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\nWorst case scenario 80000 lbs per min in 10 min period of NH3 resulting in a vapor and liquid release.  this could effect 1762 residents in an endpoint of 5.1 miles according to EPA's RMP Comp (TM) calculations.\n\nThis facility complies with state and local codes and regulations for Anhydrous Ammonia storage.  Our facility is inspected twice a year by a State of Iowa inspector.\n\nThis facility is an ag retail business and we store anhydrous ammonia for retail to farmer customers.  Our storage consists of 1-18000 gallon  tank and 15 small tanks with associates pumps, compressors and plumbing.\n\nOur facility has never had an accident.  Our alternative case would be a line breakage from the storage tank to the smaller tanks.  Excess flow valves on the lines are present for active mitigation in this analysis as they function to close whem maximum allowable flow conditions exist.\n\nThis facility's prevention programs are the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.  These concepts include: employee participation, analysis of hazards, operation procedures and safe work practices, Personnel training and maintenance.\n\nin the event of an emergency it is our policy to notify the Troy mills Fire Department and the LEPC requesting assistance.  In the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.\n\nWe have no planned changes at this time"
