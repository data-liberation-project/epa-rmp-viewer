The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Entergy does not expect the events that would cause a worst case scenario to ever occur because of the nature of the process and the provisions for safe operation that are used by Entergy.  Alternative release scenarios help the LEPC improve the community response plan. \n \nEntergy has conducted an analysis of the potential impact of the storage of anhydrous ammonia at the Lewis Creek plant using procedures developed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency for Risk Management Plans.  \n\nEntergy has evaluated a worst case scenario and an alternate case scenario as required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for Risk Management Plans.  In this case, both scenarios have the potential to cause an off-site impact of public receptors.  In order to have a scenario with an off-site impact, a scenario was chosen that is still unlikely to actually occur but does potentially allow a release of ammonia that could impact public receptors outside of the plant property.  The more realisitic scenarios that might occur during the lifetime of the SCR process were evaluated and would not cause an off-site impact under normal weather conditions.  \n\nThe chances of a release that would impact any off-site receptors is further reduced considering the safety features of the process, the safe operating procedures, and the safety training of the operators of the process.  An ammonia release is also easily mitigated by use of a water spray from a fire hose over the point of release.  Use of on-site or local fire fighting equipment would greatly reduce the amount of ammonia leaving the plant, if an accidental release were to occur.  In addition, Entergy will have available a fo"

In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel respond to control and contain such releases as appropriate.  Each situation is evaluated individually  and appropriate measures are taken to protect the employees and the community.  (Entergy, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and neighboring industries have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.)  \n\nRegulated Substances\nEntergy handles several substances regulated by the RMP rule but ammonia is the only one present in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  The information below indicates the process as defined by the rule and the regulated substance.\n\nRegulated Process:  This covered process consists of a storage tank containing a maximum of 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The liquefied ammonia is loaded into this tank from a tank truck/rail car.  This tank is supplied with redundant relief valves.  This operation is monitored by an unloading technician.  This ammonia is then transferred from the storage tank to the Selective Catalytic Reduction units on each boiler.\n\nFive Year Accident History \nThe five-year accident history includes all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.  Since this is a new process at the Lewis Creek plant, there is no accident history associated with the use of ammonia or any other chemical subject to the EPA Risk Management P"

Entergy has determined that in most cases, the use of the fogging system will prevent concentrations of ammonia from exceeding EPA's end point concentration of 0.14 mg/l of ammonia.  EPA states that nearly all individuals could be exposed for one-half to one hour to concentrations of ammonia up to the 0.14 level without any serious health effects.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on EPA's regulatory definition and not on any situation that is likely to actually occur at the facility.  EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the total release within 10 minutes of the largest single storage vessel of the regulated substance (ammonia) at the facility.  The weather conditions such as wind speed and atmospheric stability are also defined by EPA regulations for this scenario.  These are weather conditions that almost always cause the release to have the greatest impact possible for the site being studied.   The key to the analysis of off-site consequences is the concept of an endpoint.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario was developed using an assumption of 150,000 pounds (approximately 28,500 gallons at 40 degrees F) of anhydrous ammonia released at 15,000 pounds per minute for over a period of 10 minutes, representing catastrophic failure of the storage tank.  The worst-case scenario assumes that no measures were employed to stop the release, and that the event happened on a warm, calm day without sufficient wind to disperse the released ammonia.  \n\nBased on site-specific information applied to the EPA methods, the data indicates that a residential population of approximately 6,500 people (see footnote 1) would be in the area defined by the worst-case scenario.  A distance of 4.4 miles from the Lewis Creek Plant defines this area.  Public receptors such as schools, residences, hospitals, major commercial and industrial areas, and recr"

Consequently, Entergy has worked with the manufacturer of the ammonia storage equipment to prepare an alternate release scenario.  Entergy plans to install a fogging system to reduce the amount of ammonia leaving the area of the storage tank in case of an accidental release of ammonia.  Depending on the how the fogging system is used and the exact location of the release, the amount of ammonia escaping in an accidental release could be reduced from 40 to 90 per cent.  \n\nAn alternate release scenario is defined by EPA as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and uses weather conditions that are more likely to occur in the area where the plant is located.  The main factors that control the size of the area impacted by the alternate release scenario are the weather conditions and the rate at which the material is released.  EPA suggests that the alternate scenario should include some off-site impact unless there is no scenario that causes an off-site impact.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on accident release from the ammonia storage tank with more realistic weather conditions.  The alternate scenario assumes an accident that causes a small hole in the tank at or near where the fill line attaches to the tank.  A release rate of 4,830 pounds per minute was calculated based on a 2 square inch hole being caused by the accident.    If the fogging system was used the reduction in the amount of ammonia released caused by the fogging system could be close to 70 to 90 percent.  Using a 70 percent reduction, this"

This rate of release would not cause an off-site impact, so the use of a fogging system was not considered in the alternate scenario.  \n\nThere are very few realistic accidents that would cause the release of large amounts of ammonia from the process.  Most realistic accidents such as the opening of a pressure relief valve, or the failure of a line or connection would cause the release of only a small quantity of ammonia due to the automatic shutoff valves in the process.  These releases while they are more realistic scenarios, would not cause an off-site impact above the 0.14 mg/l EPA endpoint level. \n\nThe release of a smaller amount than 3,000 pounds per minute would not cause any significant impact outside of the Entergy property.  The accident described using the fogging system could cause a concentration of ammonia of 0.14 mg/l at a distance of 0.3 miles from the Lewis Creek Plant which is within the plant property.  This scenario does not show any impact above the 0.14 mg/l level outside of the plant property.  The distance to the front gate of the plant from the units is around 0.4 miles.  The distance to any residential area is greater than 0.4 miles.   \n\nIn order to have an off-site concentrations of ammonia above the 0.14 mg/l level, the release would have to be at a rate greater than 3000 lbs per minute without any reduction from the fogging system.  The alternate scenario that was chosen is based on a rate of 4830 pounds per minute based on the 2 square inch hole in the ammonia tank.  At this rate, it would take just over 30 minutes to empty the tank.   This scenario would affect an area with an estimated population of approximately 70 to 80 people (see footnote 2).

The prevention program includes implementation of procedures for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment, for conducting internal compliance audits, and for investigation of every incident which results in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The prevention program section of the RMP includes process safety information on the SCR process and specific information on ammonia.  This section of the RMP also discusses the employee training program for the Lewis Creek plant.  \n\nThe main prevention program component for the SCR processes is a comprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA), which consists of a rigorous, step-by-step examination of processes, equipment, and procedures to identify each point at which an accidental release could occur.   \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program SCR process at the Lewis Creek plant. Because the SCR process at the Lewis Creek plant that are regulated by  the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the Process Safety  Management (PSM) standard, this summary  addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system that will be in place to implement the accident prevention program once ammonia is present on-site. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nEntergy keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

      "SummaryText": "Facility Name:  Entergy - Lewis Creek plant, Willis, Texas\n\nSubmission Date:   \n\nEntergy Lewis Creek Plant RMP Executive Summary\n\nGENERAL\nEntergy is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Entergy workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Entergy has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility.  One part of this system is the Risk Management Program that complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at Entergy's Lewis Creek plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Entergy's Lewis Creek plant near Willis, Texas.\n\nThe Entergy Lewis Creek Plant is a fossil-fueled steam, electric generating facility burning natural gas and fuel oil.  The Lewis Creek Plant consists of two generating units with a combined capacity of 530,000 kilowatts.  Unit 1 initial operation was November 3, 1970 at 4:15 p.m., and Unit 2 initial operation was March 24, 1971 at 6:35 p.m.  Units 1 and 2 were designed to use natural gas as the primary fuel with No. 2 fuel oil as a standby.  The Lewis Creek Plant Standard Industry Classification (SIC) code is 4911.\n\nThe plant is located in Montgomery County, two miles west of Willis, Texas.  From Interstate 45-North, take Long St. Exit (No. 95).  Turn left on Longstreet Road and travel two miles to the Lewis Creek plant and enter through the main gate.  The area is rural with open pastures, rolling hills and forest areas.  Within 5 miles of the plant there are small subdivisions located on Lake Conroe and residential areas in the western side of Willis.  Immediately next to the plant is a reservoir that belongs to Entergy and has restrictions on public access.  \n\nTexas LNG, a liquefied natural gas facil"

      "SummaryText": "ity, is located adjacent to and due north of the plant.  The power plant and the Texas LNG facility are the only industrial facilities in the immediate area.  \n\nThe burning of fuels such as natural gas or fuel oil causes the emission of nitrogen oxides.  Nitrogen oxide emissions from many sources combine with hydrocarbons in the air to form ozone.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has determined that by reducing the emission of nitrogen oxides in the Houston area, there will be a reduction in the ozone levels.  The TCEQ has required Entergy to install pollution controls at the Lewis Creek plant.  Based on this requirement, Entergy plans to install equipment called Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units that will be used to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions from the Lewis Creek plant's two boilers.  \n\nSince, the SCR process uses ammonia, the Lewis Creek plant will become subject to the Federal Risk Management Program.  The Risk Management program is designed to promote safe operation of industrial processes.  The program is intended to protect the public and the environment.  Entergy is committed to protecting the safety of the public and its employees.  \n\nAt Entergy, our values are very simple. We believe there is only one way to do business: with fairness, honesty, and integrity. \nJ. Wayne Leonard \n\nValues: \nCreate and Sustain a Safe Work Environment\nOur goal is to provide reliable quality service in a manner that preserves the safety of our employees, the general public, and the environment. Each of us has a responsibility to ensure that this goal is met. \n\nEntergy will have as a priority the safe use of ammonia at the plant.  Entergy is developing a program that will reduce the chance of an accidental release of ammonia.  This program includes the following:\n\n1. Equipment and Processes designed for safe operation\n2. Personnel trained in the safe use of ammonia and operation of the process\n3. Cooperation with local officials including fire"

Communication with local citizens\n\nEntergy's commitment to the environment \nAs one of the largest producers of electric power in the United States, Entergy recognizes the leadership role incumbent on a company of our stature and resources.  We are advocating public policy that will preserve and enhance the environment.  And we know that we can't play a leadership role on the environment if we don't walk the talk. \n\nWhy ammonia is considered a toxic chemical?\nAnhydrous ammonia (pure, undiluted ammonia) used for industrial purposes is a very powerful chemical compared to the diluted ammonia found in household cleaning products.  Ammonia is only dangerous to the public if it is released to the air, and even then it would have to be released in a large enough quantity to drift beyond the property line of the Lewis Creek Plant.  It is important to realize that the likelihood of a release of anhydrous ammonia is very slim and the release of quantities large enough to cause longer health effects is very unlikely.  Well-trained personnel using safe operating procedures at the Lewis Creek Plant will assure safe handling of the anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nRegulatory Programs\nThe Lewis Creek plant is subject to regulation by Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Risk Management Program and by the Federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA).  Both of these agencies regulate the SCR process that will be installed at the Lewis Creek plant.  Entergy is designing the SCR process to have built-in safety features such as automatic shutoffs, flow controls, ammonia detectors, and other equipment that is designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  The personnel who operate the process will be trained in proper operation and how to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  Entergy will implement the procedures outlined in its Risk Management Plan (RMP) to assure that the public and the environment are protected."
