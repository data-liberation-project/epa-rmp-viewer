              "Description": "The facility is located on a 90 acre site, 0.25 miles east of Route 435 in the city of Gouldsboro, Pennsylvania. The cold areas are refrigerated using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the International Fire and Mechanical Codes (IMC).\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system (a maximum of 28,000 pounds of ammonia) for dock operations, ice making, and cooler/freezer storage.  The majority of each system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.  The ice makers are located in the ice maker room.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Americold Gouldsboro ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  Condensers are equipped with hydrostatic relief valves, which will prevent ammonia releases to the atmosphere.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the 2000 IMC, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\n\n\nGiven the presence of anhydrous ammonia, Americold Gouldsboro has in place a Process Safety Management program to ensure the safety of employees and the general public in the vicinity.  This program addresses items related to the operation of ammonia based refrigeration systems including but not limited to the handling of the chemical, operator training, equipment selection and maintenance, contractor qualifications, preventative maintenance programs, routine and emergency operating procedures and emergency planning and response.  Americold also has an emergency action plan in effect, which is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmmonia has a strong pungent odor which is detectable at very low concentration levels when released to the atmosphere.  The refrigeration system is designed such that under normal operating conditions, no ammonia is released to the atmosphere.  However, unforeseen circumstances or system upset could lead to leakage of a portion of the ammonia from the system.  Given the strong odor of ammonia, even a small quantity of released ammonia will be detected at some distance from the source of the leak.  Ammonia is detectable by its odor at levels well below that which will raise health concerns.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program review included an examination of the implementation of all of the PSM\n\nprograms, a review of the Process Hazard Analysis recommendations and their implementation\n\nstatus, and a determination of the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the Hazard\n\nAssessment. Following the on-site review, the hazard assessment was conducted to determine\n\nMaximum downwind distances to the listed concentration (200 ppm for ammonia). Using these\n\ndistances, the receptor data (including sensitive, environmental, and public receptors) were collected\n\nin addition to the population data within these zones. Finally, the Risk Management Program and\n\nPlan document was developed. Americold, established a Process Safety Management (PSM)\n\nProgram at this facility in October, 2011. The PSM program includes all of the RMP Program 3\n\nPrevention Program elements. These elements and how they satisfy both the PSM and RMP\n\nregulations are shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTABLE 1 Prevention Program Compliance Matrix:\n\nEPA RMP Subsection\n\n\n\nA) Employee Participation\n\n1910.119 (c)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.83\n\nB) Process Safety Information\n\n1910.119 (d)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.65\n\nC) Process Hazard Analysis\n\n1910.119 (e)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.67\n\nD) Operating Procedures\n\n1910.119 (f)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.69\n\nE) Training\n\n1910.119 (g)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.71\n\nF) Contractors\n\n1910.119 (h)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.87\n\nG) Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n1910.119 (I)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.77\n\nH) Mechanical Integrity\n\n1910.119 (j)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.73\n\nI) Hot Work Permit\n\n1910.119 (k)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.85\n\nJ) Management of Change\n\n1910.119 (l)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.75\n\nK) Incident Investigation\n\n1910.119 (m)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.81\n\nL) Emergency Planning & Response 1910.119 (n) 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nM) Compliance Audits\n\n1910.119 (o)\n\n40 CFR Part 68.79\n\n\n\nThe prevention program elements included in Table 1 are detailed in the Americold Gouldsboro, PA facility Process Safety Management program. The Facility Services Manager\n\nMaintains this document. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the Process Safety Management program, the Facility Services Manager Maintains a Piping Diagram and IIAR reference standards. These documents include the piping diagrams for each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment as well as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Bulletin 109 for this facility. These forms include physical as well as operational data for each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment.\n\n\n\nOn 4/29/2015 a review of the prevention programs was conducted. This review commenced with the Process Safety Information (PSI) to determine whether there has been any new equipment added or removed from the facility since the most recent revision of the document. Once it was concluded that the documentation was current, the Process Hazard Analysis study was reviewed to determine the implementation status of any recommendations from the initial study. \n\n\n\nFinally, the remainders of the prevention programs were reviewed with the Facility Services Manager to analyze the effectiveness of each program.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
