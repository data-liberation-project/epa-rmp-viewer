THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Brownton Co-op Ag Center are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 153,000 pounds in our storage tanks and nurse tanks.         The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n 3. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nA.    The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 0.85 miles.\n\n\n\nB.    The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review\n\nis a 2-minute release from a break in a 3-inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint\n\n(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.     \n\n          \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety  Requirements For The Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?  Published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the st"

In addition, Minnesota Dept of Ag rules.\n\n\n\n5.  THE FIVE-YEAR HISTORY.\n\n                      \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n     Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,             have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or                    environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n \n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\nA.  A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n\n\nB.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning community Right-to-Know information\n\n     as required under SARA Title 1111 (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nC.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess\n\nthe maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for the implementation at this time."
