If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information.\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\r\nA\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\r\nA\u00bf\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 52,000# in one tank, which is a 12,000 gal. vessel.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi transport with the capacity of approximately 40,000#.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or semi transport) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume the 12,000 gal. storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.0 miles.\r\nA\u00bf\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.0 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of A\u00bfSafety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1A\u00bf, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A\u00bfStorage and handling of anhydrous ammoniaA\u00bf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\tThe"
