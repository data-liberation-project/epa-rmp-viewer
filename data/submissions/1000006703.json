HP Hood LLC is committed to operating its Suffield, CT plant (Hood Suffield) in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  Hood Suffield has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  Hood has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant in conjunction and with the Suffield Fire Department and the Suffield LEPC.\n\nB. Hood Suffield is a frozen dairy and extended shelf life (ESL) product processing plant that employs anhydrous ammonia to refrigerate the cold and frozen areas of the plant.  Ammonia is the RMP covered substance at the plant.\n\nC. Hood Suffield is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the ammonia refrigeration process.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD. There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE. Hood Suffield has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the Suffield Fire Department for more extensive releases.\n\nF. Hood Suffield has a very strong safety program both at the plant and throughout the organization.  At this time, Hood Suffield has no additional changes planned to improve safety at the plant."
