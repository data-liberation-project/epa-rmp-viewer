Since the 1995 expansion all work done on the chlorine process has not deviated from orginal design specifications. Burke County LEPC has a copy of  RMP in their files.  Hazmat team has trained with chlorine kit B and is familiar with the process.   Emergency response plans are on file in the operations control room at the facility.  There is a maintenance group whose job it is to maintain the chlorine feed area.  The maintenance group is an experienced knowledgable and adaptable group.  We anticipate a review of the PSM program and RMP program after July 1 by a wastewater and wastewater engineering firm to review and rewrite our programs.\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled\nThe City of Morganton operates a wastewater treatment plant to serve residential, commercial, insititutional, and industrial customers in and around Morganton NC.  The facility is a pure oxygen type of activated sludge wastewater treatment facility.  It is designed to handle flows up to 10.5 mgd.  The regulated substance at the facility is chlorine which is used to disinfect the wastewater facility effluent.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\nThe chlorine feed area is constantly monitored by chlorine sensors.  The facility has been installed according to a professional engineer's specifications.  The materials selected for this duty are provided by reputable equipment suppliers that provide equipment to commercial, industrial, and institutional, customers throughout the south east.  All maintenance work performed is in kind work.  If any maintenance were to change the process operations there would need to be prestartup review, mechanical integrity of the process would be involved.  In addition to this employee training would be required, and  operating procedures would need to be rew"

      "SummaryText": "ritten This facility has emergency release plans on file in the operations control room for the operators to refer to. Each person has been delegated an responsibilty fromassess the leak to just leave the facility to dial 911.  Maintenance personnel are on call 24/7 to respond and make a repair if needed. Money is provided to replace any equipment that malfunctions. Redundant equipment provides immediate back up, there are two sets of scales, and piping and accedssories including vacuum breakersis set up to be easiliyt isolated.  Multiple chlorinators allow for shutdown of one chlorinator and easy switch over to another.\n\nThe five year accident history\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility\n\nThe emergency response program\nAs part of the Bioterrorism Act of 2001 a Vulnerability Assessment  for the water system requires an updated Emergency Response Plan to be completed by December 30,2004.  The wastewater system  will utilize the updated ERP.\nThe current plan has City, County, lists of personnel to notify.  Hazards addressed include the following, safety , fire, explosion, flood, power loss,tornado,water shortage,water breaks,hurricanes,and communication.  The ERP includes first aid data on chlorine. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nPlan to have an engineering firm come in after July 1 and review disinfection process at this facility.  Also plan to have an engineering firm rewrite our PSM and RMP programs.  As part of this, shopping lists will be generated and incorporated into the City's on going five year Capital Improvement Program.  As part of the VA for the water plant an updated Water Resources Department Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed with local responders, Law Enforcement, fire personnel, as well as State and Federal agencies."
