It is also imperative that plant operators and managers are appraised of the potential health hazards and exposure limits associated with this chemical.\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information includes the basic specifications on each process along with specific details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process. \nHazard Review\nA Hazard Review was also conducted for the chlorine systems.  The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a What If analysis. The What If was originally developed from HAZOP experience at similar chlorine systems by a team consisting of plant management, process operating and maintenance personnel, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself.\nRecommendations\nAll previous recommendations have been implemented or addressed.  There are no recommendations for improvements at this time.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBasic chlorine system operating procedures have been developed and documented for the facility. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine gas system. Procedures include Start-up, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and Emergency Operation as well as Troubleshooting Procedures.  O & M procedures are also included for the chlorine scrubber system.\n\nTraining \n\nTraining is required by the EPA to be included in the Risk Management Program.

Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, as well as to the off-site public.  In the event of an inspection or compliance review, state and federal regulators will request to see documentation and record keeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn Incident Investigation Program has also been developed. The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the chlorine system. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document. The Plant Manager must certify that the Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. Audit Report Forms are provided.  The two most recent audit reports must always be retained in the RMP file.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is included as part of the Risk Management Program, in case a significant release ever occurs.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nThis document was developed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP), under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR Part 68.  The disinfection process is covered under this regulation at the East Jefferson Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  \nProgram Level\nBecause the East Bank WTP is located in a residential neighborhood and is not subject to OSHA programs, the East Bank WTP is categorized in Risk Management Program Level II.  The RMP Rule divides the Program into the following three major components: Hazard Assessment, Prevention Program, and Emergency Response Program.\n\nHazard Assessment\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the chlorine system, as well as a 5-Year Accident History for the same. \nWorst Case Release Scenario \nThe Worst Case Scenario is defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10-minute duration and includes the passive mitigation related to the chlorine building.  A mitigation factor of 0.32 was determined for the chlorine building using the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Wastewater Treatment Plants Risk Management Program Guidance document.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 0.5 miles at the 3 ppm toxic endpoint concentration specified by EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was based on a fusible plug release from an overfilled1-ton cylinder containing 2350 lbs with a release rate of 437 lbs/minute, applying both passive and active mitigation of the chlorine building and the recently installed 1-ton chlorine scrubbers. A total release of 2350 lbs of chlorine was assumed in this alternative scenario.  The toxic end point for the Alternative Release Scenario was determined to be 0.0"

This was based on a 2400 SCFM chlorine gas release rate and a 3000 SCFM scrubber exhaust rate that maintained the chlorine building under negative pressure during the entire period of the release.  It should be noted that this Alternative Release Scenario release rate of 437 lbs/minute is 2.2 times greater than the Worst Case Scenario required by Risk Management Program, described above.\n\n5 Year Accident History - Chlorine\nNo releases have been documented in the past five (5) years.\n\nManagement Program\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The Program requires that a Compliance Audit to certify compliance with RMP Accident Prevention provisions at least every three years.  In addition, a revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) must be submitted to EPA every 5 years (within 5 years of the previous submission) or within 6 months of a change that results in a revised process hazard assessment or hazard review, or that requires a revised offsite consequence analysis.  A copy of the revised RMP shall also be sent to the Jefferson Parish Office of Emergency Management (OEM).  The Document Management System is largely a function of the Risk Management Program Team, comprised of the Water Purification Superintendent II, the Water Plant Maintenance Superintendent, Pump Equipment Mechanic, and Water Quality Scientist IV.  The Water Purification Superintendent II has the ultimate responsibility for this Risk Management Plan.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe Prevention Program is comprised of Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audit procedures.
