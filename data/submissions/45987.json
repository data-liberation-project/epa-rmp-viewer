Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: \u00bf888\u00bf emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, pagers, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the telephone tie lines with neighboring chemical plants, \u00bf888\u00bf telephone activation system for communication with two adjacent facilities, Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  Upon dialing 911, Rubicon can activate all or part of the CAER community emergency sirens that are designed to be heard within an approximate radius of 2.5 miles of each plant in the area where the CAER chemical facilities are located.  Rubicon can also activate the computerized Emergency Telephone Alerting System provided by the Community Alert Network (CAN) for Ascension Parish. In addition, the Emergency Broadcast System (television and/or radio) can be activated by dialing 911.  These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with neighboring chemical plant, the Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Louisiana State Police and/or the general public.\r\n\r\nRubicon works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.
