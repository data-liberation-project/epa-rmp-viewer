We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Rio Tinto Kennecott have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. Description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.\nB. Overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\nC. Five-year accident history for accidental releases.\nD. Overview of our emergency response program.\nE. Overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThis accidental release prevention program is being submitted to establish an RMP for the Furnace Off-Gas System as well the inclusion of the existing Process Safety Management Plan for the Off-Gas Conversion section of the Acid Plant.\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Rio Tinto Kennecott Smelter, Furnace Off-Gas System is located approximately 5 miles west of Magna, Utah. The Smelter receives concentrated ore (concentrate) produced from the nearby Kennecott Bingham Canyon Mine and Copperton Concentrator and processes it through a set of high-temperature furnaces to produce a high-grade copper anode. The combustion of the sulfur-bearing copper concentrate in the furnaces generates an exhaust stream of which sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a significant component. This exhaust stream is then captured by the Off-Gas System and transported via ductwork to the Sulfuric Acid Production area, where the SO2 is converted into Sulfur Trioxide (SO3) with Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) being the final product offered for sale to various industri"

The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide contained in the system at any time is approximately 7800 pounds.\n\nIn our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\nToxics\nThe amount of Sulfur Dioxide in the Furnace Off-Gas System exceeds the threshold quantity in the RMP regulation. The Rio Tinto Kennecott Smelter is located a safe distance from any residential areas, however, it is located near a Utah State Park and adjacent to an independent industrial facility providing production materials to the Smelting. It is the proximity to these facilities (public receptors)  that mandate the Rio Tinto Kennecott Smelter be classified as \"Prevention Program Level 3\" as set forth in Section 68 of the EPA regulations.\n\nUpdate:  Sulfur trioxide has been removed as a Section 1 (Covered) Process and Section 7 Program of this RMP.  Per 40 CFR 68.10(a) and General Risk Management Program Guidance, only a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity for a regulated substance in a process shall comply with RMP Covered Process and Program Level requirements; sulfur trioxide is not above the EPA RMP threshold quantity in any process at the facility.  Though sulfur trioxide was previously included in Sections 1 and 7, descriptions in these sections noted that the chemical does not exceed a threshold quantity.   This update more accurately reflects regulatory requirements, guidance, and intent of the RMP.  OSHA PSM standards and program requirements will still be maintained for the chemical.  \n\nFlammables\nThe Kennecott Utah Copper Smelter does not use, store, or handle any flammable materials covered by the RMP regulation. The Smelter does store propane for use strictly as fuel gas for the operation of our own furnaces"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is the Risk Management Program (RMP). The fourteen (14) elements of the RMP constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit. These elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Rio Tinto Kennecott and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems and to the prevention of accidental releases. In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These measures are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\n-\tEngineering and construction in accordance with recognized Industry and company standards\n-\tEquipment properly designed with protection from overpressure\n-\tUpdated technical drawings, piping & instrument diagrams and process flow diagrams\n-\tOperating systems monitored and controlled 24 hrs. a day by trained operators\n-\tComputerized monitoring and control of process operations\n-\tAutomatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems\n-\tScheduled inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance of process equipment\n-\tLimited facility access and 24 hr. security force\n-\tRadio communication system\n-\tClosed circuit television surveillance capabilities\n-\tFrequent unit surveillance by operators\n-\tAutomatic and remotely operated process shutdown to limit release quantity\n-\tDampers to control gas routing.\n\nGeneral Emergency Response:\n-\tAn Emergency Response Team specializing in fire control, spill control, res"

The ERT is made up of employee volunteers. The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response. ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis. Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior firefighting techniques, hazardous material response, confined space and high angle rescue, and emergency medical response. The Emergency Response Plan and its implementation follow the National Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Command System. The facility also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment. This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, and firefighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and firefighting foam. An inspection, testing and preventive maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment.\n\nE.
