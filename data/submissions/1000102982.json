The site has one regulated substance, a flammable mixture of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), stored in an aboveground storage tank above the RMP threshold amount. The NGL consists of a mixture of hydrocarbons including propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane. NGL is periodically loaded in tanker trucks and sent offsite.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved, as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.
