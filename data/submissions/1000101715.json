The goal of each investigation is to determine the contributing factors, and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurring or similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops proposals for corrective action, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or proposal is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Martinez Renewables conducts periodic compliance audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being followed. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

A feedstock pretreatment unit removes phosphorus, metals, and inorganic chlorides in the feedstock. Some pretreated material will also be utilized as feedstock in the facility. The feedstock must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons, must be removed of contaminants, and must be flowable to be converted into renewable fuels.\n\nUntreated feedstock begins its journey through the facility at the Pretreatment Unit. Expected feedstocks include rendered fats (i.e. packer\u0092s tallow, poultry fat), soybean oil, distillers corn oil, choice white grease, and non-neutralized brown grease. The feedstock needs to be pretreated prior to the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) unit to remove metal salts, phosphorous, and chlorides to protect downstream catalyst and metallurgy. The Pretreatment Unit combines feed with water and citric acid and heat before being sent to a reactor followed by desalters to facilitate oil and water separation. The wastewater is sent to 2 WWTP and the pretreated renewable feed can be routed to 3 HDO, 1 HDO, and/or 2 HDO.\n\nPretreated feedstock used at the facility can be fed directly to the HDO units. Oxygen and saturated olefins are removed in the HDO Units (3 HDO, 1 HDO, and 2 HDO). The reaction takes place in the presence of hydrogen gas. The HDO intermediate product then goes to the 2 HCR unit, which processes the material through a renewable ISOM/Dewaxing Reactor. The paraffins are isomerized to improve the cold flow properties and control the cloud point of the diesel to improve the product\u0092s flowability. The reaction also takes place in the presence of hydrogen. The 1 H2 Unit and 2 H2 Unit provides hydrogen for the 2 HCR and HDO units by converting natural gas into hydrogen.\n\nThe reactions in the H"

The 5 Gas Plant purifies these compounds and separates them into their respective streams of propane, fuel gas, and naphtha. These streams can be reused in the facility furnaces or sold as product.\n\nThe cogeneration facility produces electricity and high pressure steam at high temperature, which is used for both heating and cooling various processes and to drive pumps and compressors. Additional heat and steam are provided by the Hot Oil System. In the Hot Oil Unit, a heat transfer fluid (Therminol VP-1) is heated in the Coker Furnace and transferred to supply heat to three units in series. These units include: 2 HCR, 5 Gas Plant, and the PTU.\n\nThe 2 WWTP separates oil and suspended solid particles, and biological treats the PTU wastewater through a Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) unit and a Moving Bed Bioform Reactor (MBBR).  The removal of oil and solids and biological treatment prior to further processing at the downstream Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) helps prevent overloading the WWTP biological treatment system. The API Separator and the WWTP plant are part of the facility\u0092s wastewater treatment system. The Foul Water Stripper is also part of the wastewater treating system and removes hydrogen sulfide and ammonia from foul water streams. Off gas will go through two absorbing units to remove hydrogen sulfide from the gas before being burned in the thermal oxidizer.

Martinez Renewables\u0092 policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained emergency response personnel are available to control and contain the release.\n\nMPC senior management is committed to high standards of Health, Environment, Safety and Security (HES&S) performance and, as such, has adopted a policy statement emphasizing the use of management systems to drive continual improvement in the following areas: accident prevention; prevention of pollution and resource conservation; communities; security and emergency preparedness; risk assessment; legislative and regulatory compliance; training and education; product stewardship; contractor performance; performance measurement ; and communication. To help achieve the goals of this policy, MPC has adopted the Operational Excellence Management System that adheres to a \"plan-do-check-adjust\" framework. This process is followed to assess risks, set targets, and measure performance. MPC's executive leadership team meets at least quarterly with senior HES&S leaders throughout the company to evaluate performance and to discuss critical strategic issues. This forum, called the HES&S Management Committee, enables executive leadership to stay fully aware of pressing HES&S matters affecting the company and to ensure governance consistent with the Operational Excellence Management System.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to calculate worst case and alternative release scenarios for toxic and flammable substances contained in various processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The facililty has also documented the safe operating limits for specific, safety-related process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes the materials of construction, the design pressure and temperature ratings, the electrical rating of equipment, the piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nMartinez Renewables has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Martinez Renewables primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform the process hazards analysis (PHA).

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention. All approved mitigation options implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Martinez Renewables periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and tracked.

Ammonia detectors with alarms.\n\nB. Release Containment/Control\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to process flares to capture and incinerate episodic releases,\n2. Manual and automatic valves to isolate the process\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n6. Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases,\n7. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control systems, backup firewater pump), and\n8. Relief devices.\n\nC. Release Mitigation\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems,\n2. Deluge systems for specific equipment,\n3. Trained emergency response personnel,\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus),\n5. Mobile firefighting equipment, and\n6. Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nRMP and CalARP regulations require a listing of accidents occurring over the last five which meet specific criteria listed in the regulation. The facility\u0092s 5-year accident history includes one (1) incident, which involves a lost-time injury that occurred on November 19, 2023. The injury resulted from a fire caused by a furnace tube failure during unit startup operations. Consequences were limited to within the facility. The incident is under investigation and will result in the devel"

      "SummaryText": "opment of corrective actions to address the root causes for the injury.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\nFederal, state, and local regulations require the development and implementation of an emergency response plan that describes emergency preparedness and response and addresses notification of the public. The emergency response plan is also required to address the use, inspection, testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment and the training of the facility's emergency responding personnel.\n\nThe facility\u0092s emergency response program is described in a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and it consists of an emergency response organization, procedures for response and equipment for response. This program addresses emergency response for fires, explosions, releases of hazardous materials and medical emergencies. The ERP addresses coordination with local agencies and the public. The ERP has been prepared in coordination with the local emergency response area plan as required by CalARP, RMP and ISO. In addition, the ERP contains the Oil Spill Contingency Plan, the Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan and the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan as annexes. The facility\u0092s current ERP was issued in February 2022. The plan is reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the plan represents the most effective approach for protecting workers, the public and the environment. It may be revised if any of the following activities indicate the need for a change: applicable federal, state, or local regulatory changes, the ERP fails in an emergency, significant changes in facility operation occurs, the emergency contact list changes, changes occur in emergency response equipment or procedures, or a review reveals a deficiency in the ERP.\n\nThe facility is an active member of CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response).  CAER is a nonprofit group comprised of industry, agency, and community members that are dedicated to a safe and informed public."

      "SummaryText": "CAER's core objectives are safe industrial facility operations, coordinated emergency response, providing an effective safety sharing forum, and developing a trust-based relationship with the community.  Facility personnel participate in committees under its charter to accomplish these objectives, including personal safety, process safety, community outreach, emergency notification, emergency response preparedness and drill coordination, Petrochemical Mutual Aid Organization (PMAO), and Industrial Hygiene.\n\nAs a member of CAER's Petrochemical Mutual Aid Organization (PMAO) committee, Martinez Renewables belongs to a network of local industrial facilities and public agencies that focus on mutual aid response to emergencies.  The members of PMAO provide assistance (material and equipment) to any member requiring aid during an emergency situation.  The facility may request assistance from PMAO during an emergency or facility personnel may be part of a response at another facility as part of PMAO.  PMAO is dispatched through the Chevron Refinery Fire Department or Corteva Agriscience. In addition to periodic PMAO meetings, Martinez Renewables conducts periodic emergency response field exercises that involve the PMAO and other emergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nFacility personnel continue to upgrade the facility with planned changes to improve safety.  The projects selected for inclusion on this list provide significant reduction in the potential for catastrophic releases due to design changes, inventory reduction, equipment replacement and/or the project provides increased capability to respond to a catastrophic event.\n\nContinuing upgrades to the facility Infrastructure.  As part of a project to improve facility infrastructure, old tankage and pipeways are being removed/upgraded.  New tanks and pipeways will be constructed to replace some of the old equipment.  However, there will be a net reduction in storage capacity at the facility."
