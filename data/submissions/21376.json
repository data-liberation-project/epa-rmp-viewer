This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturer.  We have 8 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Carbon disulfide, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer), Propionitrile, Methyl Mercaptan, and Sulfur trioxide. \n Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used for is used as a chemical intermediate, as a drying agent and is a raw material for dyes and detergents.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used as a chemical intermediate, refrigerant, bleaching and food processing..  Carbon disulfide, Toluene diisocyanate, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] , Propionitrile, and Methyl Mercaptan are received as a waste stream for energy recovery and raw material value.  Sulfur trioxide is used as an intermediate in the production of high purity acid used in the electronic industry.\nThe maximum inventory of Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] at our facility is 34,000,000 lb., while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Carbon disulfide, Toluene diisocyanate, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Propionitril"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from TS Propionitrile.  In this scenario of 160,000 lb. of Propionitrile  [Propanenitrile] released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 420 minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario having the effect of reducing the surface area of the liquid pool.   The release does have an impact outside the facility and in the community.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Propionitrile involves a release from TS, (Treatment Services).  The scenario involves the release of 1500lbs. of liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/13/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Houston Plant maintains written operating procedures.
