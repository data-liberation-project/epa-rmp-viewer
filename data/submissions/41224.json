According to the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles, which would impact approximaely 24 people living in residences near the facility. The alternative release scenario at the BRP US Inc. Andrews facility assumes that the propane tank is overfilled, resulting in a release of approximately 4,847 pounds of propane. In this scenario, according to the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles, which would impact approximately 2 people living in residences near the facility.
