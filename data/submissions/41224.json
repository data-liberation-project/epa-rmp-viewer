If an emergency were to occur, it is their policy to notify the Valleytown Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA Description of your Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:  The BRP US Inc. facility located in Andrews North Carolina, is a manufacturing plant for recreational marine engine components. The facility uses propane in its steel parts heat treating process, and also uses it for space and process heating and forklift fuel. The propane is stored in one 30,000-gallon storage tank.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  In accordance with EPA requirements, the worst case release scenario at the BRP US Inc. facility located in Andrews North Carolina, assumes that the entire contents of the 30,000-gallon propane tank is released, a vapor cloud forms, and detonation occurs. According to the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles, which would impact approximaely 24 people living in residences near the facility. The alternative release scenario at the BRP US Inc. Andrews facility assumes that the propane tank is overfilled, resulting in a release of approximately 4,847 pounds of propane. In this scenario, according to the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles, which would impact approximately 2 people living in residences near the facility. No other public or environmental receptors are impacted by the worst-case or alternative release scenarios.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Steps:  the BRP US Inc. faciltiy located in Andrews North Carolina, complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local "
