The Broad Mountain WTP is a PA DEP approved facility constructed in 1994 and rated at 4.42 MGD.  Finished water serves portions of the Boroughs of St. Clair, Port Carbon, Mechanicsville, Palo Alto, portions of the Townships of Blythe, New Castle, Norwegian, East Norwegian and portions of the City of Pottsville.\n\n\n\nThe method of disinfecting at the Broad Mountain WTP utilizes chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5).  At any given time, the maximum amount of chlorine on site is 8,000 pounds (4-1 ton cylinders).  Since the amount is >2,500 lbs., SCMA is submitting the Risk Management Plan in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Parts 9 and 68 List of Regulated Substances and Thresholds for Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Release Prevention.\n\n\n\nThe SCMA Broad Mountain WTP qualifies as a Program 1 due to the following:\n\n\n\n(1)    For the past five years, the process has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to death, injury or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.\n\n\n\n(2)    The distance to a toxic endpoint for a worst-case release assessment conducted under Subpart B and Section 68.25 is less than the distance to any public receptor, as defined in Section 68.30.  The distance to a toxic endpoint for a worst-case release has been calculated to be 0.8 miles.  The calculation was performed using the EPA computer program RMP Comp.  The distance to the nearest public receptor is 1.0 miles.  The following assumptions were made regarding the inputs to "

Urban setting was chosen because it depicts a non-flat open\n\n    terrain.  The facility is located in a mountainous region\n\n    in a densely wooded area.

The SCMA Broad Mountain WTP has developed an Off-Site Response Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title III, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Act, Pennsylvania Act 1990-165, by the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Schuylkill County.  In addition, SCMA has prepared and submitted its Emergency Response Plan in compliance with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (PL 107-188, referred to as the bioterrorism Act).  The most recent update to the Emergency Response Plan is 8/1/06.\n\n\n\nThe Broad Mountain WTP is manned 24 hours a day.  The facility is equipped with chlorine gas detectors located in the chlorine feed area and chlorine cylinder storage area.  The cylinders are stored in an enclosed room that is isolated from the rest of the building and equipped with an exhaust system and gas detector.  This detector activates an alarm at the main control panel for response by the plant operator.  The facility is equipped with 2 SCBA's, a one-ton cylinder emergency repair kit, and dry chemical fire extinguishers.  All operators are trained in chlorine handing procedures.\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk "
