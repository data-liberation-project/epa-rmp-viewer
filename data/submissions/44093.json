The plant was initially constructed in\n\nand, as is true with most industrial plants, has\n\nundergone extensive modifications and additions over the\n\nyears. This plant is subject to the EPA Risk Management\n\nProgram Rule as it has an, ammonia refrigeration system\n\nwhich contains more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia. Ocean\n\nBeauty Seafoods has complied with both the OSHA Process\n\nSafety Management Standard and the EPA Risk & Management\n\nProgram.\n\n\n\nThe City of Kodiak is located on the northeast coast of\n\nKodiak Island and the plant is\n\nlocated in the industrial commercial area of the City,\n\nto the Southeast of the city center.\n\nTopographically, there is a steep mountain ridge close\n\nto and north and west of the plant.  Under the   worst\n\ncase release scenario, the ammonia cloud reaches only to\n\nthe end of the marina where it dissipates to below 200\n\nppm before reaching the city center. The only human\n\nreceptors in this are other seafood processing plants\n\nand commercial businesses that support the fishing\n\nindustry. As these other seafood processing plants are\n\nalso subject to the Risk Management Program, they are\n\nprepared with emergency plans in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nThe more sensitive types of receptors such as schools\n\nand hospitals would be unaffected for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the public schools and the hospital in Kodiak are\n\nlocated beyond the furthest point of the worst case\n\ndistance that the ammonia cloud would travel. Secondly,\n\nboth the schools and  the hospital are several hundred\n\nfeet of elevation gain above sea level where the release\n\nwould have occurred. Since ammonia clouds follow the\n\nlowest path, it is unlikely that any significant ammonia\n\nwould reach these locations.\n\n\n\nWith a significant release ("

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 44093,
      "SummaryText": ">:500 pounds), the affected\n\nreceptors are in industrial and commercial\n\nestablishments near the plant. These businesses would be\n\ncontacted by phone so that they can initiate their\n\nemergency plans.\n\n\n\nThe Kodiak area, like much of Alaska, is rich in\n\nwildlife; eagles, deer and other animals may wander near\n\nthe plant site, although this happens infrequently. It\n\nis possible but unlikely that an animal may be caught in\n\nthe cloud. Since this is an unlikely event and there are\n\nstrong populations of animals on the island, this remote\n\npossibility should not be viewed with alarm.\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Beauty Kodiak plant is committed to a strong\n\nsafety and accident prevention\n\nprogram. Even before the RMP rule applied, Ocean Beauty\n\nparticipated in emergency\n\nresponse training and drills. There is a continuing\n\ndialogue with the Kodiak Fire Department who would be\n\nthe first responder in the event of a significant\n\nrelease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
