The primary purpose of the facility is to repackage and distribute industrial gases to wholesale customers. The flammable and toxic characteristics of these products make it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling. Overall, the prevention of exposures and reducing the threat to associates personal health, as well as reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations. It is Airgas Specialty Gases policy to adhere to all applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nWritten policies and procedures for handling each of these products is followed each day. Maintenance when necessary is contracted out to pre-qualified companies who have trained personnel in the proper maintenance of the systems. The mechanical integrity of the systems is maintained in accordance with all good engineering practices. Contractors have access to the Operations & Maintenance manuals for all systems.\n\n\n\nThis facility has a Process Safety Management plan which is incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program requirements. The facility follows the Airgas Safety Management System that includes items such as Lockout/Tag out, Hazard Communication, Contractor Safety, etc. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place to aid in the prevention of accidental releases and natural disasters that may affect the facility. \n\n\n\nThe Brazoria County LEPC and the Pearland Fire Department have been provided copies of this plan. If a release were to occur at this location, associates would be notified of the release by activation of the audible alarm and muster at the evacuation point for a head count and notify the Pearland Fire Department if necessary.

      "SummaryText": "Pearland Fire Department is the primary response agency to a release at this location and is trained in Hazardous Materials operations. \n\n\n\nThis facility has a toxic and flammable worst case scenario. The toxic worst case scenario for a toxic release would be the failure of the vessel storing methyl chloride. This release, if the vessel were full, would have a release of 75000 pounds of methyl chloride. Active mitigation was considered for this release, including manual shutoffs. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 2.5 miles. This release scenario could impact approximately 24,091 persons in a 19.6 square mile area. This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT 4.2.4 Software.\n\n\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario for a flammable release would be tank failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank storing butane. This release if the vessel were full would have a release of 146,100 pounds of butane. Active mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. The distance to endpoint for the flammable worst case scenario is 0.4 miles. This release scenario could impact approximately 74 persons in a 0.4 mile radius. This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT software. \n\n\n\nAn alternate toxic release of methyl chloride from a PRD (pressure relief device) would be the most probable release for this location. Methyl Chloride is filled into DOT approved vessels equipped with DOT approved valves and PRDs (pressure relief devices). Cylinder valve PRD's generally are the weakest point of the package and if there was a release it most likely would occur at the PRD. If this were to happen with the methyl chloride, an estimated release rate would be approximately 83 pounds per minute for 10 minutes. This 830 pound release would have a toxic distance to endpoint of less than 0.1 miles. Within this small are"

Cylinder valves are the weakest point of the cylinder and if there was a release it most likely would occur due to a failed valve or the valve was knocked off.
