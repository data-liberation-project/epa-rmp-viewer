              "Description": "     The one-ton containers are stored in an enclosed building.  The cylinders are connected to the main header via whip lines.  Each cylinder set upon a scale, the scales are set to alarm when the cylinders become empty.  The main header is connected by piping that runs under grating in the floor to the pressure regulators and switchover valve.  The system goes from pressure to vacuum at this point.  The vacuum piping runs into the chlorinator room.  The cylinder storage room and the chlorinator room has a chlorine gas detection alarm system to warn of a chlorine gas leak as well as a ventilation system to force in fresh air and draw exhaust air into a gas scrubber system.  The ventilation and scrubber system are activated automatically in the event of a chlorine gas leak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The chlorine is then directed by a series of valves through one of three separate chlorinators.  Another series of valves control the application of the chlorine.  Chlorine continues to be drawn through underground piping to the point of application.  The vacuum is created by an open impeller induction system that draws the chlorine directly into the water stream.  The induction system also mixes the chlorine with the water stream just prior to entering the chlorine contact chamber where a minimum 20 minute contact time is maintained for disinfection.  The system will alarm in the event of a high vacuum, low vacuum, or inductor failure.",

      "SummaryText": "     Executive Summary\n     Lower  Colorado  River  Authority and the Brazos  River Authority\n     Brushy Creek Regional Wastewater System - East\n\nThe Brushy Creek Regional Wastewater System - East is an innovative and cost-effective regional sewerage system that serves the wastewater treatment needs of the urban areas in and around the city of Round Rock, Texas. The plant began expansion to a regional facility in 1995 and was completed in 1997. It has a system capacity of 11.8 million gallons per day permitted average flow; and 33.5 million gallons per day permitted peak flow. Its current average daily flow is approximately 10.6 million gallons per day.\n\nOnly chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored above the allowable Threshold quantity.\n\n     Chlorine\n\nChlorine serves to destroy disease-causing organisms in the Treatment Plant effluent. It is essential that all plant effluent have a chlorine residual of at least 1.0 mg/I after 20 minutes contact. The recommended dose for application to effluent from the activated sludge process is eight mg/L.\n\nThe chlorine is stored in eight one-ton cylinders and divided into four groups of two cylinders each. One group is in use, the second is held as backup and the third and forth groups are held in reserve. The second group is engaged by an automatic switchover module when the first group is exhausted. Each group is connected to a header that is provided with a separate vacuum regulator, which reduces the gas from a varying supply pressure to a constantly regulated vacuum. Chlorine gas feeder cabinets are wallmounted in the Chlorination Room. Each feeder is equipped with a manual rate control valve located on and adjusted from the frontof the cabinet as well as an automatic control valve, operated by PLC. Sufficient valving has been provided to allow different feeders to serve different junction boxes. Induction units provide the vacuum required to pull the chlorine gas to the various points of application. These induction units"

      "SummaryText": " create a vacuum through a motordriven open propeller, located 24 inches below the minimum water surface, which also provides mixing of the chlorine gas with the wastewater and feeds directly into the Chlorine Contact Chambers. Chlorine feed rates are adjusted by the automatic rotameters in response to changes in the flow rate. There are two chlorine contact chambers at the Brushy Creek Plant. Each chlorine contact chamber is capable of detaining a flow of 11.8 million gallons per day (mgd) for 20 minutes, but the chambers are able to detain a peak flow of around 34 mgd., when required.\n\n     Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe  concentration  of  the  chlorine  residual measured  at  the effluent  weirs  of  the  Chlorine Contact  Chambers  is  used  to determine  the  amount of sulfur dioxide dosed  at  the  Effluent Structure. The plant effluent flow is to be dechlorinated to less than 0.1 m for discharge.\n\nSulfur dioxide is stored in four one-ton cylinders, also connected to separate headers that are mounted on anchored supports. Almost all of  the  equipment used for sulfur dioxide feeding and  induction, with  the exception  of  the rotameters  and  some  materials of construction, is identical to the equipment used for chlorine induction.\n\nSulfur dioxide gas feeders, or manual rotameters, are wall-mounted. Each rotameter is equipped with a manual and automatic rate control valve. Three of these rotameters have been supplied, each capable of delivering the maximum recommended dose of sulfur dioxide. Sufficient valving has been provided so that either induction unit for this system may be fed through any rotameter.\n\nSulfonation (the process of sulfur dioxide reduction of the chlorine residual) takes place almost instantly. For this reason, it is not necessary to provide a contact chamber for detention of the flow. Sulfur dioxide is introduced into the flow at the Effluent Structure.\n\n     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAuthority policy requires "

      "SummaryText": "a written emergency action plan,  annual exercises and reviews of the plan, emergency response training for facility  personnel, and coordination with local  responders.  In addition, semi-annual safety inspections  are conducted by the Authority's Safety  Officer  and risk management consultants from our insurance company.\n\n     Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the release of 2,000 pounds of Chlorine (one-ton cylinder) in 10 minutes. The release rate is reduced to 110 Ibs./min. because the cylinders are stored inside a brick building as a passive mitigation measure. The EPA rules specify an atmospheric stability of F and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second. The maximum temperature in the last three years was 102 degrees F. Therefore, the distance to the end point for chlorine vapor is 0.9 miles in an Urban environment.\n\n     Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe plant did not have any reportable accidental releases of regulated chemicals in the past five years so we chose to analyze a broken 5/16\" valve/pipe connection at the vessel interface for both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. A vapor release was chosen because the plant does not use liquid chlorine or sulfur dioxide. EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables specify an atmospheric stability of D and a wind speed of 3 meters per second. According to Exhibit 4-15 (Chlorine-Vapor), the release rate is 15 Ibs./min. Chlorine is stored in a building so the release rate is reduced by 55% for a revised release rate of 8.3 Ibs./min. An automatic scrubber system further reduces the release rate to nearly zero. Therefore, the distance to the end point for chlorine vapor is less than 0.01 miles in an Urban environment. The very same conditions apply to Sulfur Dioxide.  According to Exhibit 4-19 (Sulfur Dioxide Vapor), applying both active and passive mitigation measures, the distance to the end point for sulfur dioxide vapor is also less than 0.01 miles in an Urban environmen"

      "SummaryText": "t\n\n     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe chemical storage area is enclosed and equipped with the latest technology to contain and scrub any chemical releases. Plant personnel are trained to handle chemical containers in such a manner as to prevent leaks or spills while connecting or disconnecting containers- Personnel are also trained to shut down the system by closing the cylinder valve in the event of an emergency or anticipated emergency. \n\n     Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere were no reportable accidental releases of regulated chemicals in the last five years.\n\n     Emergency Response Program\n\nBrushy Creek - East has the capability to respond to and mitigate the release of on-site hazardous chemicals that present a moderate health and/or safety threat to Brushy Creek - East and responding personnel, present a moderate potential for adverse environmental impact, are of limited size, and have low fire/explosion potential. If the spill/release is beyond the capability of onsite personnel, the City of Round Rock's and Williamson County's HAZMAT teams will respond by calling 911. Training and exercises are conducted periodically. The city and county recently conducted a regional WMD terrorism exercise, which included the intentional release of hazardous chemicals. They conduct annual exercises related to hazardous chemical releases that Brazos River Authority personnel participate in.\n\n     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe are conducting joint training with local first responders and conducting additional internal HAZMAT and chemical safety training for operators, maintenance, and administrative personnel. Security enhancements and procedures have been made since 9-11 and continuous improvements are made as resources become available."
