      "SummaryText": "Dalton Utilities Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorine Handling at our V. D. Parrott (River Water) Water Treatment Plant involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health, and response agency interaction.\n\n\n\nThe V.D. Parrot Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water withdrawn from the Conasauga River. Finished water from this facility serves residents in Dalton and surrounding areas along with a large industrial base comprised primarily of carpet manufacturers.  The chlorination process includes chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.\n\n\n\nFor the chlorination process, accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in an accidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case\" scenario, defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".  For the V.D. Parrott plant, an incident history review was performed to identify the most likely case scenario.\n\n\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed with the use of RMP*COMP software to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreased to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint\".  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threa"

      "SummaryText": "tening health effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario was determined for the water treatment plant.  Though unlikely, this release would possibly result from the loss of a valve stem due to the failure of a faulty packing nut on the cylinder valve assembly, resulting in the loss of the full 2,000 liquid pounds of chlorine.  For the V.D. Parrott plant, considering an enclosed chlorine room as a mitigation measure, a distance to toxic endpoint of 2.2 miles was obtained.  In support of the probability that a worst case accidental release will likely not occur, a review of process history indicates that no reportable accidental releases (greater than a 10 lb quantity) have occurred within the past five years at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenarios for the chlorination process involves the mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connection (pigtail) allowing an accidental release from a one ton cylinder of chlorine over a ten minute period, at which time the failure is repaired.  This scenario was constructed with the assumption that the localized chlorine detector (calibrated to alarm at 1.0 ppm) sounds immediately; that the manifold connection is the mechanical weak link in the equipment configuration; and that the release is in a gaseous state.  Under these conditions, similar atmospheric modeling was performed with the RMP*COMP software.  For the V.D. Parrott plant, mitigation by enclosure of the chlorine room was considered, yielding a release radius of less than 0.1 miles.  Within this radius, impact is improbable with the only receptors (9 residents) lying in the general northeast direction.  Estimated residential population was derived by modeling the 2000 U.S. Census data, which is the most current data available for Whitfield County.  \n\n\n\nThe Dalton UtilitiesA? Risk Manage"
