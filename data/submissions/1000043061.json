City of Calexico is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community.  City of Calexico staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine for water treatment.  Chlorine plays an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe facility has a long-standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine system. The facility?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the City of Calexico's Water Treatment Plant is used for the treatment of water prior to pumping into the City's water supply pipelines.\n\nThe Chlorine Room stores a total of ten (10) containers. The chlorine containers are placed on weight scales lined up side-by-side connected to the chlorine system. Normally only two (2) of the chlorine containers are kept online. The containers are connected by a yoke and adapter with new lead gaskets.\n\nChlorine gas under pressure flows from the online container through a vacuum regulator. The vacuum regulators reduce the chlorine pressure to a vacuum. The chlorine gas is suctioned out of the containers using vacuum pressure generated by a fl"

Chlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. \n\nChlorine leak detection and warning are provided by an alarm system. Chlorine detectors with alarms are located in the Chlorination Room. The alarms sound locally with indication lights at the City of Calexico Water Treatment Facility. The alarms also actuate a signal to the SCADA system. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \n\n\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab of the Compliance Workbook. The chlorine cylinders are located in a building; however, this passive mitigation measure was not incorporated in the calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by regulation.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA more realistic alternative release scenario was also modeled. The meteorological conditions specified by CalARP requirements for alternative release scenarios were used. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab of the Compliance Workbook.\n\n \n\nRisk Considerations\n\n\n\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the Community; the City of Ca"

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., protective clothing, escape mask) is used by plant personnel.\n\n2.

Detection and alarm systems with automatic notification.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key prevention program elements were implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine systems. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there are chlorine leak detectors situated in all rooms that contain chlorine.  In the event of a release the alarms sound locally with indication lights at the City of Calexico Water Treatment Facility. The alarms also actuate a signal to the SCADA System.
