Consideration was given to the amount of material released, property damage, injuries that may have occurred, actual or potential impact both on and off site the facility, resolution of the corrective actions and reviewing the incident with all affected personnel in the plant.\nThe Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant had three incidents that fall within the definition of an RMP accident in the past five years.  Two incidents involved minor hydrofluoric acid releases to the atmosphere with no off-site impact detected.  One incident involved a contract employee who received a minor hydrofluoric acid burn to his finger.\n\n5)\tThe Emergency Response Plan: \n\nHoneywell Baton Rouge has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility\u00c2\u00bfs stationary sources.  The plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental release of the materials that we handle.  The Plan provides for both internal and external community emergency alerting and notification with multiple means of communication identified.  The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the plant\u00c2\u00bfs response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire Department who would direct all offsite community notification activities.

The ERT conducts quarterly emergency response drills and exercises.  Annual in-house audits of the plant\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response system are performed.  The plant is equipped with an extensive underground fire water system supplied by 1,500 GPM and 1,000 GPM fire pumps drawing from dedicated fire water tanks totaling 325,000 gallons.  The local Fire Department Hazardous Materials team is invited to tour the facility annually.  Honeywell Baton Rouge works in full cooperation and coordination with the Office of Emergency Services.  Honeywell provides support for the installation of the Community Alert System (CAL), the community warning system of sirens, loudspeakers, and automatic telephone notification.  The Plant serves as a member of the Greater Baton Rouge Industrial Task Force, and the Greater Baton Rouge Industrial Management Association.  \n\n6)\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Re-Validation of a covered process at Honeywell Baton Rouge was completed in 2007.  As a result of this systematic safety review, several action items were identified and are being implemented to improve upon the existing safeguards at the plant and to further reduce the potential for any accidental release.  Process Hazard Analyses for covered processes containing hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, chloroform, difluoroethane, and trifluorochloroethylene stationary sources will be re-validated every five years according to their respective schedules.\n\nIn addition, Honeywell Baton Rouge has changed several methodologies utilized in carrying out its PSM \u00c2\u00bf RMP programs.

During this audit cycle, the facility will audit all of the required elements following this methodology.   This method replaces the previously used one time audit review approach during the three year cycle.   As reported in this submittal, all of the required elements were audited during the period which began September 25, 2006 and was completed on January 8, 2008 using this new methodology."
