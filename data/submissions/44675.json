All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Middle Oconee Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) utilizes chlorine to disinfect and Sulfur Dioxide to dechloronate treated wastewater before discharge to the Middle Oconee River. The chlorination and sulfur dioxide process includes chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage cylinders, chlorination and sulfur dioxide equipment, monitoring instrumentation, a vacuum flow regulating system and scrubber system. \n \nAccidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case scenario, defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the... maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" interaction.  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"  In each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint\".  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.  \n\nThe Middle Oconee WPCF has operated safely since"

A process history review indicates that no reportable accidental releases have occurred within the past five years.\n\nThe Athens-Clarke County Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of a potential chorine or sulfur dioxide release including operator training, a preventive maintenance program, process specific safety equipment and monitors, plus safe and effective standard operating procedures.  Furthermore, Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities has an environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process including a respiratory protection (SCBA), chemical right to know, hazard review of equipment and procedures, periodic auditing and inspection, and comprehensive management.\n  \nThe Middle Oconee WPCF has an emergency response plan, which has been coordinated with the Athens-Clarke County Fire Department Hazmat Response Team and Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The plan includes emergency response drills and drill evaluations.  Emergency, operational and response procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nIn an effort to further enhance plant safety and readiness, the Middle Oconee WPCF trains to the readiness standards of 29 CFR 1910.120(q).  \n\nFor additional information about this plan or any of Athens-Clarke County's water treatment plants, contact C.J.
