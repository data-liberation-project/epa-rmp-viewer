The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 100,000 lbs.\n\nUnit #27 - #3 Diesel Hydrodesulfurization Unit (#3 DHDS)\n\nThe #3 Diesel Hydrodesulfurization Unit (#3 DHDS) is designed to process 12,300 BPD of light coker gas oil and 14,600 BPD of diesel feed and to operate at 750 psig. As currently designed, the unit will process light coker gas oil feed from the Coker Unit, straight run diesel feeds from the crude unit and vacuum diesel fractionator, and tallow. Renewable diesel is being produced by the co-processing of the tallow with existing feeds into #3 Diesel Hydrodesulfurization Unit. The #3 DHDS process combines hydrogen with the straight run diesel feeds, and processes them in a high pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst. The reaction produces hydrogen sulfide, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing. The amine hydrogen sulfide mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur. The unit consumes 12.8 million standard cubic feet per day of 1,226 pounds per square inch gauge hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 parts per million (ppm) to less than 15 ppm. The #3 DHDS Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixture and liquids. The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 130,000 lbs.\n\n\nUnit #36/37 - Gasoline Blender & LPG Loading\n\nThe Gasoline Blender Unit involves blending finished fuels and shipping them to the Olympic pipeline.  The Propane/Butane Loading Unit involves the storage and shipment of LPG by rail and truck.
