SCS has also gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of the surrounding community by developing an extensive Emergency Action Plan. There are specific instructions for various types of incidents listed in the plan. Our engineers have received 24-hour HAZWOPER training and one-day annual refresher training and all employees have attended annual awareness training. This training ensures that our employees are familiar with evacuation routes and procedures in the event of a release. Evacuation drills have been conducted to ensure that employees know what actions to take in an emergency. The Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with the Tacoma Fire Department and the Pierce County Emergency Management Department.  The Tacoma Fire Department will be responsible for coordination with other local authorities in the case of off-site evacuations, including the Puyallup Tribal Nation. Visitors to the site are required to check in and are informed of the ammonia hazard and the evacuation procedure. \n\nThe SCS Tacoma facility is located at 2302 Milwaukee Way, Tacoma, WA 98421. This facility is a frozen food and cold storage facility where both receiving and distribution of food products occurs on a daily basis. There is 11,274 pounds of anhydrous ammonia contained within the refrigeration system. This facility is covered by and complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Standard.\n\nThe Five Year Accident History (per 40CFRA?68.155(e) review verifies that no accidental releases have occurred.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan (EAP), as prescribed under the EPA's Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.95 addresses the fundamental steps to be taken in response to an ammonia release. The Emergency Action Plan describes situations where public safety (fire and police) would need to be notified and where evacuations may be needed. The RMP coordinator is responsible for conductin"
