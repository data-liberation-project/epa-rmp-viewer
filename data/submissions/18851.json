Wholesales treated water to 19 water districts, is a non-profit Public Trust and Is governed by a Board of Trustees made up by the water users.\n    Regulated chemicals are stored in original shipping containers. Containers are changed only during daylight hours with a two-man team of trained operators.\n    PVIA treats an average of 3.5 million gallons of raw water per day pumped from Lake Wister. The primary disinfectant is chlorine. We store a maximum of 10-12 thousand pounds of chlorine on site in 2000 lb. shipping containers. The chlorine is fed into the finished water under vacuum at a rate of 150-200 lbs. per day depending on the disinfectant demand.\n    The worst case release scenario for this facility would be a ruptured shipping container, containing the full 2000 lbs. This unlikely event would have off site impacts.\n    PVIA and the locale Rural Fire Department has worked out an evacuation plan for off site receptors. This facility is in a rural area and any off site receptors will be few. We have considered passive mitigation and are in the process of installing dikes and water spray piping to cover the stored shipping containers. Alternative scenarios are a leaking gasket at the connection between the shipping container and our vacuum feed equipment or a leaking pressure plug on the shipping container. These events will not have off site impacts. Passive mitigation will keep these events to very small releases.\n    Our supplier tests shipping containers before they are filled and shipped to us. Trained operators connect containers to our feed system. Passive mitigation is being installed. We conduct training with locale Fire Department.\n    We have had one release in the past five years. A leaking pressure relief plug caused this. The amount released was about 4 lbs. This small release had no off site impacts.  The locale Fire Dept. stood by while the supplier respo"

The plant manager or the emergency coordinator will be notified by the plant operator of a problem. A decision will be made based on the information received as to what resources are mobilized and to evacuate if needed. A telephone roster is kept by PVIA and the Fire Dept. for warning receptors depending on the wind direction.\n    Training is ongoing with the locale Fire Dept. passive mitigation equipment is being installed.
