Plant personnel do not fight pentane fires. Upon detection of a pentane fire, personnel are instructed to initiate automatic shutdown of the process which removes heat, closes isolation valves and depressurizes equipment. OREG 4 and Trailblazer Pipeline personnel are then alerted of the need to evacuate the site. Responding fire department personnel assume incident command upon arrival. Callout procedure: If any of the following alarm conditions are indicated by the OREG4 monitoring system, the call-out procedure must be followed: OEC failure, security/fire alarm trip. If any of these events should occur the monitoring staff will immediately contact the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manager. If the O&M Manager is not reached in a timely manner the parent company, Ormat Nevada Inc. will be notified on the 24 hour phone number (775) 852-1912.

Personnel are trained in standard operating procedures and emergency response procedures. Additionally, safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites.

Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Industrial Hygiene and Standard safety procedures manuals.\nMaintenance: OREG4 management tracks maintenance on electronic spreadsheets. Maintenance documentation includes information on all equipment in the facility requiring maintenance, inspection, testing, certification, calibration, etc. NFPA, OSHA, manufacturer's recommendations and operations experience have been utilized to produce a comprehensive maintenance tasks that are scheduled and assigned to plant personnel.

The motive fluid (pentane) on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive an organic fluid turbine. The turbine drives a generator which produces grid-compatible power. The turbine exhaust vapors are then condensed in an aircooled heat exchanger and enter the cycle again as a liquid. On the thermal oil side of the heat exchangers, after exiting the heat exchangers, the thermal oil is routed through a thermal oil surge tank, thermal oil feed pumps, and back to the WHOH.\nThe power from this project is sold to Highline Electric Association based in Holyoke, CO. The facility is rated at 6000 KW. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5100 KW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air cooled heat exchangers.\nUse of Regulated Substance\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as the working fluid in the organic Rankine cycle. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section.\nThe sections include: the low pressure process equipment, the high pressure process equipment, pentane unloading system, vapor recovery system, evacuation system and non-condensable removal system. Each section is protected by pressure relief systems that may include pressure safety valves, pressure control valves, control system shutdown and intervention logic and administrative practices.\n\nQu"

(OREG4) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. OREG4 provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe OREG 4 process is located adjacent to a gas pipeline compressor station. The pipeline compressor is driven by a natural gas turbine. The OREG process is fueled by waste heat from the gas compressor's turbine exhaust. Waste heat is converted to electrical energy by utilizing organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid reaches a maximum temperature of 572\u00b0F. At this particular location, there are two turbines exhausting to two WHOHs. The heat transfer fluid flows in parallel to the WHOHs, then recombines to feed the single\nOrmat Energy Converter (OEC). In the OEC, the recomb"
