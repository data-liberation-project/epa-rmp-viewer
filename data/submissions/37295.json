The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe Winn-Dixie Dairy, located in High Point, North Carolina, is a manufacturing facility owned by Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.(Winn-Dixie). Winn-Dixie requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixie's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe Dairy is located at 1350 West Fairfield Road, northeast corner of the city of Highpoint, Randolph County, North Carolina.  The facility consists of areas for manufacturing and packaging of dairy products and cooler storage of these perishable items for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets.\n\nThe Dairy has one ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  All of the ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the compressor room.   The high pressure receiver (HPR) is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding approximately 10,800 lbs. of ammonia.  \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe ammonia process at the Dairy is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the process at the Program 3 level.  The PSM Program was reengineered in 1998 for the ammonia process.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accid"

      "SummaryText": "ents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Dairy also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Dairy refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Dairy facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has"

Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying North Carolina State Warning Point at 1-800-858-0368.\n\n6.   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the compliance audits then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner."
