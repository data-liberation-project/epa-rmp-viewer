(Olympia Foods) facility located at 9501 Nevada Avenue in Franklin Park, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?

Olympia Foods Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Olympia Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Olympia Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Olympia Foods' policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Facility Identification\n\nThe Olympia Foods facility is located at 9501 Nevada Avenue in Franklin Park, Illinois.  Olympia Foods is a producer of raw and pre-cooked gyro meats, as well as pita and flatbreads.   \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311812.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated food processing and to preserve products for distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating processing areas, coolers and freezers in the facility. \n\n\n\nThe total amount of ammonia being charged to the refrigeration system is approximately 22,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system will be charged in two (2) phases. The initial charge will be to the low temperature system, and is anticipated at approximately 10,000 pounds. The remainder of the ammonia charge will be added to the system at a later date. \n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.

The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation - Olympia Foods has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Olympia Foods maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of July 21, 2015.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Olympia Foods has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented.
