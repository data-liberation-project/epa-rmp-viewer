      "SummaryText": "Maberry Packing, LLC is a raspberry processing, freezing and storage facility located in rural Whatcom County, outside the Town of Lynden in Washington state.  The plant uses approximately 14,100 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia in their refrigeration systems.  There are two engine rooms with separate closed systems.  Because portions of the two systems are located in the same processing room, the amounts of ammonia in the two systems were added together to determine the Program Level to be 3.  One system has approximately 9,600 lbs, and the other 4,500 lbs.\n\n\n\nA Hazard Assessment was performed using two scenarios in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Section 1129(r) under the Clean Air Act.  The off-site consequences would affect very few people even in a worst-case scenario.  The facility is surrounded by raspberry fields on all sides, with some homes lying beyond.  All the homes are sheltered by large evergreen trees.  The owner of Maberry Packing is the closest home to the facility.  \n\n\n\nMaberry Packing's management has made every effort to train personnel, maintain all equipment, and limit employee turn-over to insure a safe and secure work place.  Employees do not respond to releases of ammonia, but have been trained to inform their supervisor if they smell ammonia.  Employees practice an evacuation drill with set assembly areas every year.  The Whatcom County Fire Department has stations within 2 miles, and have hazmat trained responders.  The fire department has been given copies of Maberry's Emergency Response Plan, and tour the facility annually. \n\n\n\nFor this 5-Year Resubmission an updated Hazard Assessment was performed.  The population has had a very small change from 5 years ago.  The Program Level continues to be 3, as the quantity of ammonia has not changed.  There have been no releases of ammonia in the past 5 years, and employees continue to be trained plus attend annual Ammonia Safety classes.  "
