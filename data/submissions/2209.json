WE HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS POSED BY STORAGE AND USE OF CHLORINE AND HAS ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS TO PREVENT ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES AND TRAINING FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE.\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF THE CHLORINE IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT IS TO DISINFECT THE WATER.  CHLLORINE IS DELIVERED AS A COMPRESSED GAS AND LIFQUIFIED GAS IN ONE TON CYLINDERS AND THERE ARE USUALLY FOUR(4) ONE TON DRUMS AT THE PLANT AT ONE TIME.   FOR PLANNING PURPOSES WE CONSIDERED THE IMPACT OF A SUDDEN RELEASE OF 1500 POUNDS  OF CHLORINE GAS WITHIN A TEN MINUTE PERIOD OF TIME.   THIS WORST CASE ASSUMPTION HAS A  POTENTIAL OF IMPACT OF 0.8 MILES.\n\nTHE CITY OF SDEGUIN WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT HAS IMPLEMENTED SAFETY PROCEDURES TO PREVENT AND MANAGE ANY CHLORINE RELEASES.
