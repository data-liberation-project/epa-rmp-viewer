      "SummaryText": "The City of Alliance owns and operates a water treatment plant and a wastewater treatment plant in Alliance, Ohio.  Both plants use chlorine for disinfection, which is classified as an extremely hazasrdous substance.\n\nTwo release scenarios (worst-case and alternate-case) were modeled using the Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres, ALOHA(R), computer program.  The worst-case scenario for chlorine (i.e., catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects causing a direct release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine at either the water treatment or wastewater treatment plant over a 10-minute period) resulted in an endpoint of 2.6 miles.  The estimated number of people residing in the 2.6-mile radius is 25,000.  The alternate-case scenario (i.e., a gaseous release through a short pipe or valve) resulted in an endpoint of 0.41 mile.  The estimated number of persons residing in the 0.41-mile radius is 55.  \n\nSInce the plant uses and stores chlorine in excess of 2,500 pounds, it is subject to federal requirements including preparation of PSM and RMP programs.  Stringent RMP requirements (known as \"Program 3 Level\") apply to the City of Alliance because of Ohio's OSHA jurisdiction.  The City of Alliance has developed an emergency plan to provide employees with specific details for emergency operations.  Additionally, in-house procedures are in place for training personnel on the chlorine system, mechanical inspection of equipment, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response and action plan.\n\nThe City of Alliance has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place in the past 5 years."
