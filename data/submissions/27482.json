Executive Summary\n\nPotlatch Corporation is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Potlatch employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Arkansas Pulp and Paperboard Division in McGehee, Arkansas, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Cypress Bend Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Cypress Bend.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Cypress Bend Mill.\n\nThe risk management program at the Cypress Bend Mill consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.6\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Potlatch Corporation helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The Cypress Bend Mill does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility similar to the Cypress Bend Mill and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by the Cypress Bend Mill.

There are no environmental receptors within this distance.  \n \n The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a 4? chlorine dioxide solution (1 wt%) transfer line from the storage tank to a bleach plant mixer.  This scenario assumes that the solution is pumped through a severed line at 180 gallons per minute, and workers require 20 minutes to detect the release and stop the transfer pumps.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.1 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that 20 people live within this distance from the mill.  The Bunge Corporation Grain Terminal and the Mississippi River are public receptors within this distance.\n \n1.3.2  Water Treatment Chlorine Storage and Transfer (1 ton cylinders)\n\nNo worst-case scenario is reported for one (1) ton chlorine cylinders because the effects of the worst case scenario for chlorine dioxide exceeds those of the worst-case scenario for an accidental release from a one (1) ton cylinder.

      "SummaryText": "ical-specific Prevention Steps\n \n Since its inception in 1977, the Cypress Bend Mill has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer, the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes. In September 2000, chlorine for pulp bleaching and anhydrous ammonia were removed from service and are no longer present at the site.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Cypress Bend Mill?s Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.  \n \n 1. Process Safety Information.  Potlatch Corporation maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the mill processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Cypress Bend Mill, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment in the mill.  The Cypress Bend Mill ensures that this process safety information is available to all Potlatch employees and local fire and emergency response personnel.\n \n Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Cypress Bend Mill, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes.  MSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available to mill operators for ready reference. \n \n The engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n2. Process Hazard Analysis.  The Cypress Bend Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The Cypress Bend Mill primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to mill personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  \n3. Operating Procedures.  Potlatch Corporation engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal op"

Training.  Potlatch Corporation trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The Cypress Bend Mill training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Employees that work closely with hazardous chemicals receive specialized training for operation and maintenance of process equipment.  Demonstrations and employee observations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.\n5. Mechanical Integrity.  The Cypress Bend Mill maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in mill processes.  The mechanical integrity program includes:\n\n- specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment\n- specifications for replacement parts and equipment\n- procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment\n- procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, and line or equipment opening\n- training of maintenance personnel\n- documentation of maintenance activities\n\n6.

All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n7. Pre-startup Review.  The Cypress Bend Mill performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n\n- construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n- adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n- employee training has been completed\n-for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n8.

Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a 1 weight percent chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\n1.6 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Cypress Bend Mill has had no releases during the last five years while handling chlorine or chlorine dioxide that have resulted in any offsite public or environmental effects.
