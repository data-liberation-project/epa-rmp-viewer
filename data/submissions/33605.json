      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Trinity River Authority of Texas (TRA is a political subdivision charged by legislative mandate with three functions.  These include the maintenance of a Master Plan for basin-wide development, serving as a local sponsor for federal water projects, and providing services authorized by the Texas Legislature within TRA?s defined territory that includes all or part of seventeen counties encompassing approximately 17,500 square miles. \n\nTRA?s greatest impact to the general public is ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  TRA provides essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around Lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is TRA?s duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary, respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.  \n\nTRA?s Tarrant County Water Supply Project (TCWSP) began operation in 1974.  At that time, this facility was providing treated surface water to the cities of Bedford and Euless with a combined population of approximately 35,000 people.  The Tarrant County plant provided the two cities with six million gallons of surface water each day.  Since construction in 1974, the plant has been expanded five times and currently has a treatment capacity of 72,000,000 gallons per day and serves the cities of Bedford, Euless, North Richland Hills, Colleyville and Grapevine.  The facility is located on Trinity Blvd. south of the City of Euless.  The quality of treated water leaving TCWSP meets or exceeds all established standards.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nAs a result of federal requirements, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the TCWSP is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the quantity of chlorine and ammonia that it uses in its treatment process.  In developing its R"

      "SummaryText": "MP, TCWSP has conducted an analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental release including a ?worst-case? and ?alternative case? release scenario.  In addition, the facility has compiled a five-year accidental release history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The TCWSP has an outstanding safety record and there have been no accidents related to chlorine and ammonia processes in the past five years.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nTCWSP places the highest emphasis on safety and hazard prevention.  To this end, we have developed a comprehensive prevention program that includes the following key points:\n\n?   Annual training is required by all operations and maintenance employees who work in and around hazardous chemical storage and loading areas.\n\n?   Visual inspections of these covered processes are conducted by operations personnel on each shift.\n\n?   Sensors and alarms are in place around all process areas to detect any leakage of the hazardous chemicals.\n\n?   Written operating procedures are continuously updated and maintained for operations personnel to use during their work routines.\n\n?   All accidents are investigated promptly with written documentation of all findings.  These accident investigations are reviewed by management and Certified Safety Professionals to determine cause and prevention.\n\n?   Monthly safety audits are conducted of all plant process areas including covered process areas.  Written documentation of these monthly audits, including actions taken to correct problems, is maintained for a minimum of five years.\n\n?   Preventative maintenance programs for covered processes are in place and a computerized records management system is in place to automatically generate reports regarding preventative maintenance needs and/or histories on all covered process equipment.\n\n?   Project personnel on various safety issues that are pertinent to covered processes conduct monthly safety meetings.\n\nThese above procedures have"
