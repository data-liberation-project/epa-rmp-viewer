Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed, and much of the training has been ongoing.  Given that AE is a new facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nAE has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nAE?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area.  This area is separated from the plant and equipped with a fire suppression system.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  AE has coordinated with the St. Ansgar, IA and Lyle, MN Fire Departments for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe AE ethanol plant is located on the Iowa side of the state line between Mona, Mitchell County, Iowa and Lyle, Mower County, Minnesota.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is anhydrous ammonia.  AE has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 4.4 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  AE also has a 188,000 gallon denaturant storage tank however the flammab"

      "SummaryText": "ility rating is three (3) and therefore exempt from RMP regulations.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all 102,420 pounds of ammonia stored on site creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 4.4 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 4.4 mile radius.   \n\nAlthough AE has numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage the potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince AE qualifies for Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, a Process Safety Management Plan has been completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies for Program 3, an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) is required.   The ARS for ammonia is the toxic release of 4,780 pounds per minute.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.9 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within this distance that would be affected by the alternative release.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nAE has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite. There have been no accidents at this time.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe AE ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An FRP & SPCC Plan will also be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  AE?s corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
