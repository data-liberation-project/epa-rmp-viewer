      "SummaryText": "This facility is a potable water treatment plant located in State Farm, Virginia.  It supplies the VADOC State Farm Complex, Beaumont Juvenile Correctional Center, and the Town of Goochland with potable water.  Two one-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are stored on site for the purpose of disinfection.  The facility is located in a rural area in Goochland County.  Within a worst-case endpoint distance of three miles, there is an estimated total population of 4,500 including the prison, residences, and some Goochland County commercial buildings.\n\n\n\nThe facility has taken steps to prevent accidental release of the stored chlorine.  The two one-ton tanks are located in an enclosed room with negative pressure venting to the roof.  Additionally, they have manual emergency shutdowns, relief valves on the two tanks, various interlocks, a leak monitoring system, and audible alarm with computer screen alert.  Employees receive 18 hours of training on the chlorine storage/feed systems.  On the job training is mandatory, and testing includes demonstration, written, and oral testing.  There have never been any releases of chlorine from this site.\n\n\n\nThis facility has a written Emergency Response (ER) plan for the chlorine operation developed by the Virginia Department of Corrections.  The plan includes a methodology for informing the public, with phone lists updated annually.  The plan also includes annual emergency health care training, including first aid and CPR.  The ER plan is coordinated with Goochland Country Fire and Rescue Department and local Fire-Rescue Chief, William McKay.\n\n\n\nThe facility officially changed it's name in 2018, from James River Correctional Center, Water Treatment Plant to State Farm Work Center, Water Treatment\n\nPlant. All other administrative information remains the same.\n\n"
