Produced fluids travel through flowlines from each wellhead to tank settings where the liquids (oil and water) are separated from the gas.  Liquids are then carried from the tank settings to a central production facility.  Gas is carried in separate gathering pipelines from the tank settings to the Pressure Maintenance (PM) compression plant.  The gas is used as lease fuel, processed to extract natural gas liquids (NGLs), compressed for gas lift and enhanced oil recovery, or sold.  Propane extracted from the processed gas via the Liquid Extraction (LEX) plant is stored on-site and loaded into tanker trucks for distribution locally in Alaska.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Hilcorp Alaska, LLC (Hilcorp Alaska) Environmental, Safety & Health Policy; the Swanson River Facility will not put profitability before safety or protecting the environment.  The facility analyzes the risks of their activities and puts appropriate controls in place to prevent injuries, environmental impacts, and any other incidents.  The facility ensures the integrity of their processes and equipment, the training and qualification of their workforce, and proper review and communications of their activities.\n\nIt is the intention of Hilcorp Alaska to comply with all applicable industry policies and federal, state, and local regulations.  The Swanson River Facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements for propane storage, and the Hilcorp Alaska Environmental, Safety & Health Policy.  If an emergency were to occur, the facility would immediately notify the Kenai Peninsula Borough Central Emergency Services - Sterling Station.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance\n\n\n\nPropane (CAS No. 74-98-6), which the Swanson River Facility extracts from the processed gas and stores on-site as a liquid under pressure, is on the list of regulated flammable substan"

The propane extracted is stored on-site in a storage vessel that is administratively controlled to a maximum allowable capacity of 80% of the design capacity (32,000 gallons).  Operators visually monitor and record the level in the propane storage vessel every twelve hours.  In the event the vessel nears 80% full, facility operators will configure the propane extraction process to recycle, thereby stopping extraction of propane from the gas stream and preventing the vessel from exceeding the maximum allowable capacity.  The worst case release scenario analyzed for propane identified that no residential populations would be impacted.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Swanson River Facility utilizes various detection alarm systems designed to warn of abnormal conditions that could result in injury to personnel, equipment damage, or impact the environment.  These detection systems are tested on a set maintenance schedule to assure their operation.  A Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the propane extraction and storage systems at the facility is conducted every 5-years.  When changes to the propane system are made, a Management of Change (MOC) process is followed.  This process is designed to identify potential hazards being introduced by a change, and, to allow all necessary personnel to be informed of and trained on the change.  Process and management system improvements are implemented based on PHAs, periodic compliance audits, and MOC findings.\n\n\n\nThe propane system at the Swanson River Facility is subject to and complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule (29 CFR ?1910.119).  The facility is covered by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and has an Oil Discharge and Contingency Plan (ODCP) that outlines the prevention and response strategies in place.  The Swanson River Facility is also in compliance with and has a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.  \n\n\n\nFive-"

Response to emergencies at the Swanson River Facility are coordinated with the Kenai Peninsula Borough Central Emergency Services.  Public notification of emergencies are carried out through the Kenai Peninsula Borough 911 system which includes an automatic notification telephone ring down system to alert Borough residents to emergencies which could affect them.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the Swanson River Facility include using PHA recommendations to improve the integrity of the process as well as selection of a new management of change tool to support improvement of the management of change system."
