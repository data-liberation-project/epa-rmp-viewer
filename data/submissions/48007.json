      "SummaryText": "El Centro Generating Station (ECGS), located at 485 East Villa Avenue, El Centro, California operates their boiler units along with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox).   SCR is a post-combustion flue gas NOX emission control technology that removes NOX from the flue gas downstream from the combustion process.  A reducing agent is used to reduce NOX emissions, primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst.  The most common reducing agent (reagent) used with SCR is ammonia.  Injection of the correct ammonia/air mixture into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of Nox emissions upstream from the stack.  The ECGS uses anhydrous ammonia (60,000 lbs) as the reagent for the SCR reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nDue to the hazardous nature of anhydrous ammonia, the ECGS is required to develop and implement specific regulatory requirements, as enforced by the both local and federal government agencies.  Specifically, the ECGS is required to develop a Risk Management Plan (RMP), conduct a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), develop a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and conduct a Seismic Analysis (SA) of the facilities, operations, and equipment.  Requirements for the ECGS are primarily dictated by the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and the Risk Management Program.  All regulatory requirements enforced over the use of anhydrous ammonia at the ECGS are found within:                                                                                                                                                              "

A single 12,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tank is provided to support the various SCRs at the ECGS.  Maintenance and refueling of Ammonia Tank has been contracted out by the ECGS to Air Gas (formerly La Roche Industries).    Transport of Anhydrous ammonia to the ECGS will be by means of tanker trucks, with individual deliveries of about 3,000 to 5,000 gallons.                                                                                                                                                                                         \nThe 12,000-gallon horizontal storage tank has a 9-foot outside diameter and is 23-feet and 5-inches in length.  The storage tank lies within an enclosure and adjacent to the unloading area.  The floor beneath the storage tank is slightly sloped towards a sump (with drain) in the north western corner of the enclosure.  This area is sloped to contain and drain accidental spills.  In addition, the ammonia-handling facility is equipped with extensive ammonia detection and alarm systems to protect workers and equipment in the event of a malfunction anywhere in the system.

The quantity of ammonia on-site will also trigger the federal RMP program pursuant to Section 112? of the Clean Air Act.  An RMP is required under the CalARP program and at the discretion of the local administering agency (AA).  In Imperial County, the AA is the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC), which also enacts as the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA).  The DTSC has informed the ECGS that an RMP will be required in connection with the anhydrous ammonia system in operation at their facilities.  The ECGS was given an initial deadline of December 31, 2006 to fully complete and submit their RMP.  An extension to this deadline was obtained from the DTSC until January 31, 2007.  This extension comes in light of no documentation being required or submitted by the facility since their RMPP report (in 1992) when the anhydrous ammonia system was initially being installed.  The RMP to be submitted by January 31, 3007 will include a Seismic Analysis (SA), a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the proper RMP submittal documentation.  The RMP documentation will be submitted in both electronic and hard copy format.  URS Corporation (URS) has been contracted to conduct this RMP, along with all necessary analyses previously mentioned.  In the future the ECGS will be required to complete updates to its RMP program on a 5-year basis or if any changes are applied to the ammonia system or the facility.
