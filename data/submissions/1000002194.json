Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\no Process safety information\no Process hazard analysis\no Operating procedures\no Training\no Mechanical integrity\no Management of change\no Pre-startup review\no Compliance audits\no Incident investigation\no Employee participation\no Hot work permit\no Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1.  All unloading operations are actively monitored.\n2.  Plant operating personnel perform daily visual inspections of equipment.\n3.  Plant operating personnel perform monthly leak checks for fugitive emissions from pumps, valves, flanges, etc.\n4. The waste fuels tank is located within a secondary containment dike. Tank integrity is checked at least annually by an outside contractor.\n5. The waste fuel system is highly automated and will automatically shut down during certain furnace problems or upset conditions. \n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. The Chemtrade Refinery Services goal is to have ZERO incidents- zero distribution, zero safety, and zero environmental incidents.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe keep records for all significant incidents that occur at our facility-whether they are safety or environmental release related. The Chemtrade Refinery Services, Beaumont facility has had one significant accident involving the process covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years. Th"

There was no vinyl acetate being fed to the process at the time so there was no release of vinyl acetate. There were no offsite injuries or environmental impact. In order to include this incident in this RMP submittal, incremental values for duration of release (1 minute) and amount of release (1 pound) were input so that no errors would appear. \n         \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Chemtrade Refinery Services, Beaumont facility has a written emergency response plan which has been updated as of August 1, 2008. Our plan provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n    1)Continue to enhance operator training\n    2)Implement \"Goal Is Zero\" program for safety and environmental incidents\n    3)Utilize new Management of Change database\n    4)Utilize new Incident Management System database\n    5)Full time Environmental, Safety & Health supervisor at site.\n    6)Achieve compliance with CCPA - Canadian Chemical Producers Association\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\nFor RMP covered processes, the undersigned also certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted in this Risk Management Plan is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nSignature: Nestor Gomez\nTitle: Plant Manager\nDate: 6/17/09\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT DATA ELEMENTS\nThe following pages present additional information about our risk management program that EPA's RMP rule has asked us to provide.
