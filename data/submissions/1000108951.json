As part of this commitment, INEOS has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) which helps manage the risks and which complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: the RMP rule. This summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 through 40 CFR 68.185). \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nINEOS is committed to the welfare of its employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment. INEOS implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, INEOS will conduct emergency response action to help prevent or minimize harm to the public and the environment. \n\nFacility Process and Regulated Substances \n\nThe INEOS Oligomers La Porte is a chemical manufacturer of polyalphaolefins (PAO), a synthetic hydrocarbon chain for use in a variety of consumer applications. The manufacturing process uses boron trifluoride (BF3) and ammonia for producing PAO.  Both are regulated substances above the threshold quantity. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n1. Process Safety Information - Oligomers La Porte maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the covered processes. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled. The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards. \n\n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Oligomers La Porte regularly performs risk assessments of the c"

A corporate procedure for the conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk includes consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public. \n\n3. Operating Procedures - Oligomers La Porte maintains its operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. \n\n4. Training - To complement the written procedures for process operations, Oligomers La Porte has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operators receive both on-the-job and classroom training. A unit walkthrough test and final peer review ensure trainees have the required level of practical knowledge. In addition, all operators receive refresher training at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. A record of all operator training is maintained.\n\n5. Mechanical Integrity -  Oligomers La Porte has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The  components of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\n6. Management of Change (MOC) - Oligomers La Porte utilizes a management of change program to ensure the proper reviews are conducted, hazards assessed, and safe operation is maintained during and after a permanent or temporary change is"

Each MOC includes a risk assessment to identify the potential hazards of the change as well as review of  a supplemental checklist to identify any effects of the change on areas such as Safety & Health, Environmental, Process Engineering & Control, and Maintenance. \n\n7. Pre-Startup Review - Oligomers La Porte performs a thorough review on any new or existing process modified in a manner which requires updating of process safety information. This review confirms (1) the change was made as per the agreed upon design , (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a risk assessment has been conducted, and (4) training has been implemented. \n\n8. Compliance Audits - Oligomers La Porte performs PSM and RMP compliance audits at least every three years. Audits targeting specific regulatory element requirements may be performed more frequently through the Operational Audit process, if needed. \n\n9. Incident Investigation - Oligomers La Porte investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment. The incident investigation procedure requires an investigation team to be assembled and that the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented. \n\n10. Employee Participation - Oligomers La Porte promotes employee participation via the site Safety Committee which consists of representatives from upper management, operations, maintenance, logistics, SHE, and resident contractors. \n\n\n11. Hot Work Permits - Oligomers La Porte mitigates hot work hazards with a Safe Work Permitting process. \n\n12. Contractors - Oligomers La Porte reviews all contractor qualifications prior to working on or near a covered process.

In addition, procedures are in place which control contractor entrance, presence, and exit from the site. \n\n13. Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - In addition to engineering review and hazard analysis previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving covered chemicals receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures developed by INEOS in conjunction with the chemical supplier. In addition, several safeguards are in place such as: hydrocarbon detection, automated deluge systems, periodic piping and vessel inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring. \n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nINEOS Oligomers La Porte has established a written emergency response plan which complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plans. This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel. The facility has an operator on each shift who is a fully trained volunteer responder that belongs to the adjacent site LyondellBasell emergency response team, to ensure 24-hour coverage. INEOS Oligomers conducts quarterly emergency response drills including annual drills coordinated with the local response authorities. INEOS Oligomers La Porte is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA). CIMA supplements on-site emergency responders at neighboring facilities in the event that additional resources are needed. The facility is involved with the CAER network to communicate with the local community in the event of an emergency. \n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidents and/or significant near-miss incidents involving the site's two regulated substances during the last five years."
