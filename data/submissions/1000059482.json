As part of this commitment, Equistar has established a system to help \n\nensure safe operation of the processes at the Tuscola Plant. One component of this system is a \n\nrisk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with \n\nthe requirements of the Environmental Protection (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental \n\nRelease Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule); and the \n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) \n\nStandard (29 CFR 1910.119).

When a hazardous substance is used, the chemical must be \n\napproved by the Health, Safety, and Environmental Department by undergoing an environmental and safety \n\nanalysis on the chemical to consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect the plant \n\nworkers, the public and the environment.

Equistar \n\nimplements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a \n\nhazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained \n\nto reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely \n\nadhered to in the design, construction, installation and operation of the equipment.

In addition, Equistar requires \n\nthe documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with \n\nregard to these procedures as part of the management of change process.

Equistar provides response \n\ntraining to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response \n\nactivities, conducts regular drills to review response activities and coordinates response efforts \n\nwith area industry and the local emergency response agencies. Equistar trains its workers to \n\nrespond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, \n\nEquistar works with the area industry, the local fire department and the Local Emergency \n\nPlanning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release \n\ndoes occur.  Response activities have been discussed with the Local Emergency Planning \n\nCommittee and the Douglas County Mutual Aid Association.\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Plant, in conjunction with local emergency responders, conducts emergency drills to ensure community wide preparedness in case of an incident at the plant.  Through these efforts, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays \n\nabreast of community concerns and works to address them. \n\n\n\n2.
