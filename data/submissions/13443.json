      "SummaryText": "The Pitchford Elevator Co. location at Nashville Illinois has had Anhydrous Ammonia on the site for 5 years without a reportable release.  This is a clear indication to the dedication of the facility management to maintenance and safety.\n\nThis location is a full service agricultrual facility with grain storage facilities, dry and liquid fertilizer materials, agricultural chemicals, seed, and offers custom application of both fertilizer and chemicals.  The facility has one Anhydrous Amonia storage tank and over fifty (50) 1000 gallon nurse tanks to deliver the ammonia from the storage tank to the local farmers for use.  The facility services growers with materials over an area of a twenty (20) mile radius of the location.\n\nUnder a worse case scenario for the location 140,000 pounds of material would be discharged in a ten minute period if the storage tank was at it's greatest capacity.  The facility used the Degadis-tfi model for making its effected area calculations.  The distance to the end point of the release would be 1.16 miles from the tank location.  Within this area there would be 1500 persons that could be impacted if the material spread equally from the point of release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the location involves a failure of a transfer hose during transport unloading into the storage tank.  Again the Degadis-tfi model was used for making effected area calculations.  Under this model there would be a release of twelve thousand (12,000) pounds over a 2 minute period.  The effected area for this situation would be .56 miles from the hose failure.  Within this area two hundred fifty (250) people would be effected if the material spread equally in all directions.  The amount of the release should be less than the model indicates due to excess flow valves on both the storage tank and the transport tank that would close in case of such a failure.  there is also a back-flow prevention valve at the hose hookup point on the storage tank that would c"

Should the excess flow valve on the transport fail to close in this situation there is a manual emergency shutoff valve located on the transport.\n\nThis facility operates under the guidelines set forth by the Illinois Department of Agriculture for Anhydrous Ammonia facilities.  The facility is inspected by the Department at least annually and is maintained to their specifications.  The facility is also inspected by an inspector from the facilities insurance company and kept within their specifications.  Some of the requirments of the insurance company are stricter than those of the Department of Agriculture.  In addition to the requirments of the inspections listed above the facility has an ongoing maintenance program that insures the tanks and associated equipment are always in the best condition.  As a part of this program all dated items such as hoses, valves, and relief valves are replaced no later than their expiration date.  In addition all parts of the instullation are inspected during daily activities of the facility.\n\nThe facility management is confident in the process of training and maintenance that is used at the location.  As an indicator of the success of the program the location has had no accidents to report over the last five years.\n\nOur emergency response program is coordinated through local agencies.  There are systems in place for notification of the local agencies in case of the need.  The employees of the location are trained as to whom to notify in case of an emergency.  This training is done on an annual basis by an outside consulting company and also as ongoing on the job training by the facility management.  There are postings of emergency phone numbers at phone locations on the site so that they are available whenever needed.\n\nThe ongoing equipment updating at the facility ensures that the safety of the location will always be improved.  As improvements to the equipment are offered to the industry the facili"
