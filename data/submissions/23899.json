Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have two RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substance are Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70% and Aqueos Ammonia 30%.  Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Hydrofluoric Acid 70% onsite at any one time will be 44000 lbs\n\n2. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is received in bulk by tank truck and off loaded into a 15,000 gal storage tank. The Ammonia Aqueous is then repackaged into 55 gal and 330 gal containers and moved into storage for distribution to our end use customers. In addition to the repackaging of smaller containers we also load tank trucks from our 15,000 gal storage tank for distribution to our end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be 64,948 lbs \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases from each of the RMP substances in inventory onsite. Each RMP "

For each Alternate Release Scenario onsite Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment were considered for active mitigation. RMP COMP software was used for modeling purposes. \n\n1. Worse Case Scenario release of 33,660 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of .3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L.\n\n2. Alternate Case Scenario release of 450 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of <0.1 miles is obtained using class D stability and 3m/s wind speed.\n\n3. Worse Case Scenario release of 385 lbs Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, the maximum distance of 0.1miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .016 mg/L.\n\n4.
