The Facility Policy\n          The management and employees of Heinrich Feeds, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or any other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information\n         - A major activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n          -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application by farmers.\n          -The maximum quantitiy stored would be 109,420 pounds in our two 12,000 gallon tanks.\n            The maximum quanity handled would be would be the unloading of a rail tank\n            car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3.The worst case release scenario and the alternative worst case release scenario:\n          a. The worst case release scenario would be the total release  over 10 minutes as a result of a collision of a derailed railcar with an anhydrous ammonia railcar being unloaded at the siding. The maximum quantity released would be 150,000 pounds which represents the volume of a rail tank car. The distance to the endpoint( at at dispersion to 200ppm) is 2 miles.\n\n          b.The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose from an anhydrous ammonia railcar being unloaded at the siding. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1 mile.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program\n\n          The facillity has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhy"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations  for the implementation at this time."
