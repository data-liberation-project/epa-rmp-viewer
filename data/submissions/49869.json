      "SummaryText": "AGC Flat Glass North America, Inc.  Taylor County,  West Virginia\n\nThe Jerry Run Flat Glass manufacturing facility began operation at it current location in 1975.  With the exception of some minor modifications this 650 ton per day of glass production facility operates at originally started up in 1975.  The only 112r listed material stores at the facility in quantities above trigger levels is sulfur dioxide which is reveived in low pressure one (1) ton cylinders.  No flammables or below threshold 112r materials have the potential to travel to an endpoint beyond the plant boundry ( 150 feet) under winds of 15 mph.\nFor the Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) which would be released as a gas, the endpoint under winds of 15 mph with an entire 2000 lb. cylinder release over a ten minute period is 0.50 mile.  The nearest residential area is 0.8 miles from the plant boundry with no schools, churches, other commercial operations or government owned facilities within 1.5 miles of the facility.\nThe facility has developed and tested the SO2 cylinder handling and SO2 gas application system standard operating procedures.  The adherence to these procedures make any release very unlikely.  There have never been more than a few pounds of SO2 released since placed in service at the plant.  These minor releases result from cylinder change over.  The facility has nevered experienced a release of five hundred (500) pounds or more of SO2.\nAn emergency response program has been prepared to provide the maximum effective impact in the least amount of time:\n         1.  Use the plant intercom to report a suspected release\n         2.  Trained and properly equipped maintenance personnel access the release\n         3.   If release of >10 pounds has occurred, dial 911\n         4.   Utilizing established safe operating procedures to isolate the release point from the cylinder."
