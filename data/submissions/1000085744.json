The program includes engineering, education, waste water, and storm water management.\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Program: The Green Bay Dressed Beef facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting. Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated the hazard of ammonia with the local fire department and LEPC. The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: Green Bay Dressed Beef is a harvest and food processing plant located at 544 Acme Street, Green Bay, WI. The building houses a processing plant used for harvest, processing, freezing, and packaging. The processed products require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. There are two Machinery Rooms: one located on the west side of the plant, and the second located on the southeast side of the plant.\n\n\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There has been one reportable accident that occurred on October 17, 2019. Additional details about this release can be found within Section 6 of the submitted RMP for the facility. Additionally, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The s"
