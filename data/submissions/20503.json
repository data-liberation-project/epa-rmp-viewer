      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJakov P. Dulcich & Sons utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their \ncold storage facility near McFarland, California.  As it is Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons' \npolicy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage \nfacility was designed and constructed during 1995-96 to the 1991 Uniform \nBuilding Code/Uniform Mechanical Code.  Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons monitor the \ndaily operation of the refrigeration system.  All service, maintenance, and repairs \nto the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to a qualified licensed \nrefrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an \nexperienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, maintenance, and \nrepairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons' objective to be a responsible citizen of the \ncommunity in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage \nfacility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency \naction plan has been prepared for Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons and a chain of \ncommand to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nJakov P. Dulcich & Sons owns and operates a cold storage facility located at \n31956 Peterson Road.  McFarland is the closest city to the Jakov P. Dulcich & \nSons Cold Storage facility.  The rural plant was constructed during 1995-96 \nutilizing all new equipment at the time of construction. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for \nthe Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons cold storage facility.  The refrigeration system \nconsists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, three \ncompressors, an evaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, and several \nflooded evaporators.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed thr"

However, during major maintenance activities, the entire \nrefrigeration system can be \"pumped down\" to evacuate the ammonia from the \nsystem and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of \nammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 15,390 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define \nthe toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This \nconcentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or \ndeveloping irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could \nimpair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \nplanning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons' ammonia-based refrigeration system is \nconsidered a Program 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the \noffsite consequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential \npopulation within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  \nThis area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the \nrelease would travel with concentrations at or above the toxic endpoint.  The \ncircle also defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.\n\nThe worst case release i"

For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Jakov P. Dulcich & Sons, the alternative \nrelease scenario was selected based on the results of the Process Hazard \nAnalysis (PHA) for the ammonia-based refrigeration system.  A credible release \nevent with a high discharge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite \nimpact.  Although not likely to occur, a release from a pressure relief valve was \nchosen as the alternative release scenario.    \n\nJakov P. Dulcich & Sons has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-\ncase and alternative release scenarios.  For the worst-case release scenario, the \nrelease of 15,390 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minute period outside of the engine \nroom, the plume would travel 1.5 miles at concentrations at or above the \nendpoint.  Using 1990 Census data, the population potentially affected within the \nworst-case release scenario circle is 233 persons.  Due to the rural location of \nthis facility, the population potentially affected by this worst case release is \nsubstantially overstated by the 1990 Census data.  There were no environmental \nreceptors within the worst case release scenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a release from a pressure relief valve was \nmodeled as ammonia vapor stored under pressure.  For a release of 158.7 lb/min \nof anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere, the model calculated that the plume \nwould travel 0.1 mile at concentrations at or above the endpoint.
