Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Brenntag Southeast Inc are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental  release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the  processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n \n \n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n    \nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, Ammonia (aqueous).                              \n \nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (aqueous) is 70000 Lbs.,\n \n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for  each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Hydroxide.  In this scenario 2472lbs. of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the spread of product.

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L  is 0.1 miles.\n \n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n \nProcess Safety Information\nBrenntag Southeast Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/14/01.\n \nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Southeast Inc maintains written operating procedures.

Refresher training is provided at least every  year and more frequently as needed.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nBrenntag Southeas Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n \nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Brenntag Southeas Inc to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 06/01/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n \nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Southchem Inc.
