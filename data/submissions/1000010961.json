Anhydrous ammonia is the RMP-regulated substance at the facility. The ammonia is used in the process as a refrigerant to cool and liquefy the carbon dioxide.  The plant has ten full-time employees\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a hazardous chemical and subjected to federal and state laws.   Air Liquide Industrial has established policy and procedures to manage the industrial system and process that contains the ammonia in accordance with applicable regulations in particular OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM (26CFR1910.119) and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP (40CFR68) regulations.  \n\nThe Wood River facility\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program contains the technical and process information required to safely maintain and operate the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and minimizing the risk of an accidental release of ammonia to the environment.  These documents address chemical properties and associates hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operational limits for key process parameters. The Risk Management Program encourages the employees to participate in the process safety management and accident prevention through ongoing training and communication on all key elements such as Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change (MOC), Pre-Startup Safety Review, and Incident Reporting and Investigation.\n\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the Wood River facility\u00c2\u00bfs anhydrous ammonia refrigeration was performed in 1997 and the most recent five-year revalidation was completed in 2009.   The results of the PHA serve as the basis to improve the facility\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program.  Inspections and audits are also an integral part of Air Liquide\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management procedure and corporate safety oversight and compliance program. The Wood River faci"

In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, the Wood River employees will respond defensively by notifying offsite emergency responders that there is a need to respond to a release of the regulated substance.  The Wood River facility also maintains communications with the Roxana Fire Department as part of its emergency planning.   If an emergency event is expected to have offsite consequences that could impact the community, the Roxana Fire Department and the Madison County Local Emergency Planning Committee (along with other State and Federal Emergency agencies) will be notified so they may initiate the appropriate community response (evacuation, shelter-in-place).  \n\nThe Wood River CO2 facility has had an excellent record of accident prevention.  In the past five years, there has not been an accident that has caused deaths, injuries, property damage or environmental damage, nor one requiring evacuation or shelter-in-place for the surrounding community."
