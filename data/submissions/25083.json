Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and compressors to eliminate over pressurization conditions.  A complete drawing of the refrigeration system is on file with the Local Fire Department and Local Emergency Response Commission.  These drawings show an in depth outline of our system with al safety valves, solenoid valves, king valves and isolation valves.  These valves are placed in the drawing in their exact location and are numbered both on the drawing and tagged in the facility.  With the help of these drawings and tagged isolation valves, responders are aware of what valves to close, once entering a hazardous area.  A periodic maintenance program is in place at American Seafoods to ensure the refrigeration system and its components are kept in optimal mechanical and operating status.  American Refrigeration Maintenance Management checks the refrigeration system on weekends for any form of malfunction.  In our five year history American Seafoods has had one accident to report on 01/08/01 (case # 552906).  This incident was handled by our emergency response personnel which included the following steps:  Evacuation of employees and evaluate the situation; Once the emergency response personnel determined this was an emergency situation; calls were placed to the local Fire department and LEPC, Company personnel, trained in responding then put on appropriate gear and isolate the hazard.  This was not a drill or a test, yet American Seafoods emergency response personnel had isolated the hazard before any local emergency response personnel had arrived.  Results, no fatalities, no serious injuries."

Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency and the same properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable refrigerant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions.  To prevent exposure to our workers, surrounding community and the environment, it is our policy to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by: Managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations, Forwarding our Emergency Response Plan to the Local Fire Department and Local Emergency Response Commission, Informing the community Of the potential hazards and Minimizing the risk of an accidental release.   Our plant personnel have been trained am the equipment operating procedures and various safety devices, which are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of an accidental release.  Key employees have been trained to isolate areas within the refrigeration system, which may become hazardous.  These employees have attended the 24-hour emergency response-training course in ammonia refrigeration and attend the annual eight (8) hour refresher course.  Safety depends on the proper handling of Anhydrous Ammonia in this facility and American Seafoods will ensure that the safety or its employees comes first.\n\nThe following engineering controls are in place at American Seafoods International, LLC.  These controls are designed to reduce the possibility of an accidental release.  Electronic Ammonia Detection systems have been installed in the refrigeration room and other areas within the system.  Alarm activation is both visual and audible to alert plant personnel of an ammonia leak.  High-level switches will shut down associated compressor operations during a high level condition.  All compressors are configured with critical safety controls (high pres"
