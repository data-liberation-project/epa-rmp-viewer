The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are involved in reviewing the PSM  Program.  Tri-Marine Fish Company has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Tri-Marine Fish Company facility is located at 220 Cannery Street, San Pedro, California 90731.  The plant is located less than 1 mile south of Freeway 47 (Harbor Freeway) on Terminal Island.  The immediate area is primarily industrial with commercial and residential areas to the west across Los Angeles Main Channel.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses approximately 20,000 pounds (3,600 gallons) of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver (TSY-1) to the High Pressure Receiver (HP-1).  High pressure liquid ammonia is transferred from HP-1 to the Intercooler (IC-1), the Brine Chiller (CH-1), and a liquid subcooler which  constitutes the Single Stage (C5) compressor assembly.  Ammonia is returned from CH"

RC-1 supplies liquid ammonia to five Blast Freezers Evaporators (PC1 - PC5, PC13 & PC14) and a mixture of partially vaporized ammonia is sent back to RC-1.  RC-1 also transfers ammonia back to HP-1 through the use of a Liquid Transfer System (LR-1).  Liquid ammonia is supplied to the Liquid Recirculator #2 (RC-2) from C5's liquid subcooler.  RC-2 supplies liquid ammonia to Freezer #1 Evaporators (PC6 - PC9) and Freezer #2 Evaporators (PC-10 - PC12).  A partially vaporized mixture is then sent back to RC-2. Hot gas from the compressors is used as a defrost for all evaporators (PC1 - PC14).\n\n\n\nVapor is pulled from the recirculators, RC-1 and RC-2 to the five compressors.  Discharge from two Booster compressors (C3 and C4) is returned to IC-1, whereas, the discharge from the High Stage and Single Stage compressors (C1, C2, and C5 respectively) is sent to the two Condensers (EC-1 and EC-2).  A thermosyphon supply and return from TSY-1 is sent to the compressors for oil cooling.  High discharge vapor is condensed to a high pressure liquid through EC-1 and EC-2 and returned to TSY-1.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The system also has a diffusion tank (into which the relief header vents), which is kept full of water.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Tri-Marine Fish Company facility including the  ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include  ammonia sensors and automatic shut down buttons both located throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn inves"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Tri-Marine Fish Company has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, Tri-Marine Fish Company plans to evacuate all employees and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The primary evacuation assembly area is the southern loading dock.  Tri-Marine Fish Company plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Tri-Marine Fish Company facility located at 220 Cannery Street in San Pedro, California.  The Revalidation was comprised of one session that consisted of the HAZOP study, a site inspection, the completion of safety checklists, a discussion of any changes to the ammonia system since the previous HAZOP Study, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the previous PHA, and a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years.  The changes are scheduled to be completed by July 2015.\n\n\n\nIn addition the facility is planning"
