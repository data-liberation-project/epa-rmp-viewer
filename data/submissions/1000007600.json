Rohm and Haas first came to Tennessee in 1943 as part of the national defense effort in World War II.  In a government-owned Plant, the company began production of Plexiglas acrylic sheet for use in American military aircraft.  Following the war, Rohm and Haas purchased the Knoxville facility and expanded its production capabilities to include acrylic polymers.\n\nAlthough no longer a Plexiglas manufacturer, the Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville Plant continues to provide acrylic polymer products which are used by our customers in the manufacture of laundry detergents, facial creams, diaper wipes, paint, caulk, paper coatings, and fiber filled products. In all phases of its operation, the Plant stresses safety and protection of the environment.\n\nWe are pleased to provide information on our safety and emergency preparedness plans, as well as the systems and training at Rohm and Haas designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and incidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate A?worst caseA? and A?alternative caseA? scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to"

This summary is part of the Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville PlantA?s communication effort.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe RMP regulated chemicals used by the Plant in the manufacture of acrylic polymers are Acrylonitrile, Aqueous Ammonia (~30% Ammonia Gas in Water), and Vinyl Acetate.   Each chemical is listed as an RMP toxic chemical.  Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate are raw materials that are chemically combined to form acrylic polymers.  Aqueous Ammonia is used as a neutralizer to adjust the pH of polymers.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville Plant has a long standing commitment to providing a safe workplace and implementation of procedures and practices to prevent accidental releases.  This commitment is clearly stated in the Plant Environmental, Health, and Safety policy: \n\n- Environmental, health, safety, and medical considerations are as important as production and operational concerns when decisions in these areas are required.\n\n- We will provide a secure workplace free of unacceptable risk to our employees, our community, and the environment.  \n\n- We are committed to the Rohm and Haas Company environmental, health, and safety principles and will comply with all relevant EHS regulations and standards, including the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care Guiding Principles and Codes.\n\n- We will provide our employees with the necessary training, information, and equipment to work safely and in an environmentally acceptable manner.\n\n- Each employee will be responsible and accountable for working safely and protecting the environment.\n\n- We will have emergency response and contingency plans in place to address potential incidents.\n\n- We will provide opportunities for each employee to participate in the process of continually improving our EHS performance.\n\n- We will provide programs to assist employees in maintaining good health.\n\n- We will manage our emissions, "

We prevent accidents by taking measures to create and maintain safe conditions in all aspects of our operations including design, operations, and handling.  Examples of our safety protection measures include:\n\n- Redundant safety systems and instrumentation\n- Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n- Secondary containment for storage tanks\n- Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters\n- Pressure relief devices to prevent overpressurization\n- Fire protection systems\n- Comprehensive written procedures and training programs\n- Operator surveillance of unloading operations\n- Safety permit system to control work in hazardous areas\n- Preventative maintenance program for equipment\n- Work preplanning\n- Extensive Management of Change (MOC) program\n- Controlled entry to Plant site\n- Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) reviews for new processes and significant changes in existing processes\n\nPlant prevention programs are designed in accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards.  Additionally, the Plant is required to comply with safety standards developed by the Rohm and Haas Company Corporate Environmental, Health, and Safety Department which, in some cases, are more stringent than OSHA general safety standards. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville Plant has had no accidental rele"

The plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans and is intended to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a hazardous material spill, protect the well-being of Rohm and Haas employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the Plant response plan have been provided to the local Police and Fire Departments, a local hospital, and the local and State Emergency Management Agencies.  \n\nA trained on-site incident commander is assigned the responsibility of coordinating the Plant response to any incident which may occur including communicating response needs with the local Fire Department responders.  A trained incident commander is on duty at the Plant 24 hours per day.  Plant evacuation drills are held at least annually.  Furthermore, the Plant holds A?table topA? exercises to discuss and drill on the proper response to a Plant emergency scenario. Alarm systems are also periodically tested.   All Plant employees are trained on the relevant aspects of the emergency response plan.  \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario, namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel occurring under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed.

Based on previous Plant history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, these worst case scenarios are highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe Plant worst case scenario is documented and is based on the detailed requirements for worst case scenarios as prescribed by the RMP rule.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternative release scenario.  Unlike worst case scenarios, the alternative release scenario can be limited by active mitigation and safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.  According to EPA, the alternative release scenario is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders for emergency response preparedness and planning.\n\nThe alternative case scenarios for the Plant were chosen after review of the Plant spill history, process hazard analyses, and discussions regarding potential scenarios with knowledgeable and experienced operating department personnel.  The identified scenarios are more credible than the worst case scenario, but remain unlikely due to the design of the equipment and training of our employees.\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nIt is our belief that effective environmental, health, and safety systems must be continually improved.  We constantly strive to recognize areas for improvement and implement the changes necessary to achieve our goals.  Methods used to identify areas for improvement include:\n\n- Process hazard analyses for manufacturing processes\n- Internal audits of procedures \n- Plant inspections\n- Safe behavior sampling\n- Weekly review of completed safety permits\n- Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) reviews for new processes and significant changes in existing processes\n\nIn addition, the following are examples of safety improvement opportunities identified and implemented by the Plant for an RMP covered chemical.\n\n- Installation of retention diking around tank truck unloa"
