      "SummaryText": "Marshall Durbin Companies operates a poultry processing plant at 3301 Third Avenue in Jasper, Alabama.  Producing a safe and wholesome product requires that the poultry be processed and stored at low temperatures, so as to prevent spoilage.  A refrigeration system which uses ammonia as a refrigerant is used to acheive these reduced temperatures.\n\nThe maximum amount of ammonia ever present is approximately 18,000 pounds.  \n\nA worst case scenario was developed using the EPA's RMP Comp software.  If all the ammonia present in the system was discharged (18,700 pounds), it would require the evacuation of the community within a 0.8 mile radius of the plant.  Due to all the safety procedures and equipment in place, this scenario is unlikely.\n\nAn alternative release model was developed using the same procedure.  If a lesser amount of ammonia was discharged (9000 pounds), it would require the evacuation of the community within a 0.8 mile radius of the plant.\n\nEquipment is constantly being upgraded and reviewed to assure safe operation of the refrigeration system.  There has not been an accident in the last 5 years in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n"
