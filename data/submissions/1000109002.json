The Palestine Plant is used for the manufacture of alkylated specialty chemicals (e.g., emulsion breakers, surfactants), which are predominantly used in the oil and gas industry. The process involves reacting ethylene oxide with various common chemicals, such as fatty alcohols and phenols, to produce a variety of products.\nThe facility is subject to the Program Level 3 RMP requirements. [The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation also applies to the facility because the EO onsite exceed the PSM limit of 5,000 pounds.]\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Verdant release prevention program that are in place at the Palestine Plant. \n\n2.\tEmergency Action Plan\nVerdant complies with applicable federal, state, and local regulations related to emergency response plans. This facility has an emergency action plan that provides instructions to employees on how to respond to an emergency. Employees and contractors at the facility are trained in the key aspects of the emergency action plan. Employees and contractors are also informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training.\nVerdant coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) so that the LEPC is aware of the EO and PO operations and the emergency procedures proposed in the Palestine Plant Emergency Action Plan.

Studies undertaken by teams of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and were revalidated at least every five years. Findings and recommendations related to the PHAs were addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA for the Covered Process was completed in January of 2023. \n\n6. Operating Procedures\nVerdant maintains written operating procedures to safely conduct activities in the Covered Process. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in these processes.\n\n6.\tTraining \nVerdant has a training program to for employees tasked with operational processes and procedures. Refresher training is provided at least once every three years.

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n8.\tManagement Of Change (MOC)\nVerdant has a written Management of Change process for the Covered Process to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or other employees whose tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to address the modifications. \n\n9.\tPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nVerdant has a Pre-startup Safety Review program for the Covered Process. The facility performs Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of the Covered Process. The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. A completed PSSR is required prior to introducing hazardous materials to the process.\n\n10.\tCompliance Audits\nVerdant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being implemented. The last compliance audit for the facility was completed in December of 2022.\n\n11.\tIncident Investigation\nVerdant investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of EO or PO. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.
