This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release.\n\nDecription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex consists of eight operating units linked by multiple pipelines. The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The complex also operates a terminal and storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The complex produces 4.5 billion pounds of ethylene per year. In our process, we use the following chemicals the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics: None\n\nFlammables: Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane, 1,3-Butadiene, Propyne, Isoprene, 1-Pentene, Propadiene, 1,3-Propadiene, 2-Pentene(E), Vinylacetylene\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex.

For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety-related limits for specifc process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document.  The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nSweeny Complex also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm the safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nSweeny Complex has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSweeny Complex primarily uses the HAZard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis tenchniques to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design features. Sweeny Complex periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this fequency until the process is no longer operating.The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nSweeny Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as, (1) Unit startup, (2) Normal operations, (3) Temporary operations, (4) Emergency shutdown, (5) Normal shutdown, (6) Initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Complex maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures f"

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nSweeny Complex uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their workin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knwledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace,(4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,(5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
