This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release.\n\nDecription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex consists of eight operating units linked by multiple pipelines. The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The complex also operates a terminal and storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The complex produces 4.5 billion pounds of ethylene per year. In our process, we use the following chemicals the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics: None\n\nFlammables: Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane, 1,3-Butadiene, Propyne, Isoprene, 1-Pentene, Propadiene, 1,3-Propadiene, 2-Pentene(E), Vinylacetylene\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex. Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses"

      "SummaryText": "each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nSweeny Complex management encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accidental prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sweeny Complex's Accidental Release Prevention Program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accidental Release Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Sweeny Complex Process Safety Management System and in addition, Sweeny Complex has a number of teams to promote both process safety and personal safety. The teams typically involve members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nThree key areas for employee participation include the EmployeeBehavioral Safety Process (RAPTOR), Employee HES Excellence Team, and the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) subcommittee.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSweeny Complex maintains a variety of technical documents that are used in the safe operation of the processes.

For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety-related limits for specifc process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document.  The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nSweeny Complex also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm the safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nSweeny Complex has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSweeny Complex primarily uses the HAZard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis tenchniques to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nSweeny Complex uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their workin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knwledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace,(4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,(5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Sweeny Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of the contractor.
