We have very well structured programs that meet and/or exceed the regulatory requirements set forth by OSHA and the EPA.\n\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety programs include Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Process Safety Management program; including subtopics and procedures for process safety information. Other important elements of PSM are employee involvement, process hazard analysis, prestart-up safety review, management of change (PMR), inclusion of SOPs and P&IDs, employee training, contractor supervision, mechanical integrity program, hot work program and permitting, incident investigation, lockout/tagout program, confined space entry program, and an environmental monitoring program. These programs demonstrate a consistent effort to minimize or eliminate potential releases; while providing for systematic responses should an emergency occur. Environmental monitoring includes numerous stationary detection devices used to identify minute chemical releases at ppm levels and to generate alarms for immediate response. We also have the ability to alert local emergency response services through redundant modes of communication as well as community siren for alerting our community and neighboring facilities. Based on RAGAGEP and Title V Air Permitting requirements, all instances of environmental alarms, both false and actual, are investigated and documented including findings and actions taken, if required.\n\n\n\nThis executive summary will provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nDescription of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\nOverview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\nFive-year accident history for accidental releases\n\nOverview of our emergency r"
