The atmospheric products [oxygen, nitrogen, and argon] are separated cryogenically from the air, while the hydrogen feedstock gas is purchased from Occidental Chemical (OxyChem) and Olin via pipeline from their neighboring facilities.  Hydrogen gas is a by-product of our suppliers? chlor-alkali manufacturing processes.  Trace impurities of water, oxygen and nitrogen are removed and the nearly pure hydrogen gas is then compressed, liquefied, and stored in two insulated spherical cryogenic storage tanks.  The liquid hydrogen is then transfilled into insulated containers to maintain its liquid state, and transported via truck to customers all across the eastern United States and Canada.  The facility, which is staffed and operated on a continuous basis, was originally built in 1980 and expanded in 1989.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, and stores liquid hydrogen, a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity as established by the EPA.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council"

Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard and EPA?s Risk Management Program rule, the Niagara Falls NY facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems;\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity; and \n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \n\nPraxair has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented extensive safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nFor hydrogen, the facility has automated chemical monitoring, alarm, and/or isolation systems in each compressor building, both liquefiers, and the trailer filling area.  Both area and plant Plant Emergency Trip systems are strategically placed both inside and outside the production areas to ma"

Active mitigation control, consisting of several hundred automated alarm and several dozen shutdown systems, exist to protect either feedstock supply, each hydrogen compressor or turbine, the storage tanks, and many pieces of auxiliary equipment.  A new distributed control system, using the latest security protocols, enables employees to access the entire facility from multiple locations.  Numerous ?double block and bleed? manual isolation systems also exist to provide positive isolation of hydrogen when necessary.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Niagara Falls facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last four years. There was one (1) covered process release that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident, which occurred on October 19, 1999.  A Production Technician sustained first- and second-degree burns to a portion of his neck when hydrogen was released from a fill port on a liquid hydrogen trailer.  The process was isolated and the hydrogen supply extinguished.  Approximately 116 pounds of hydrogen was released.  New procedures and equipment were installed on all hydrogen trailers in Praxair to prevent its re-occurrence.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Niagara Falls location will be a ?non-responding facility? as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Niagara County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the City of Niagara Falls Fire Department (NFFD).

We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvements that have reached the planning stage.  In 2003 the seven computer control systems for the hydrogen production plant, some of which dated back to 1980, were replaced with one state-of-the-art distributed control system with up-to-date performance, reliability, and security capabilities. The system enables employees to access the entire facility from multiple locations, observe real-time status of every alarm and shutdown in the facility, and modify operating setpoints as necessary to ensure both safe and efficient operation."
