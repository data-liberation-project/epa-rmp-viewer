Most outdoor facility areas, other than a parking lot and shipping and receiving docks, are secured by building walls and a chain link fence. The individual processes and storage facilities are scattered over 22.3 acres so that an incident at one will not involve another process.\n\nI-K-I is committed to being a good custodian to both our employees and community. In the design and operation of the processes within the facility, a prime consideration is the evaluation of the chemical hazards inherent in the products packaged. As a result, we ensure that all equipment used to process, store, or handle highly hazardous chemicals is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in order to minimize the risk of chemical release. We have also established and implemented written procedures to maintain the ongoing mechanical integrity of our process equipment. In addition, we ensure that the frequency of our mechanical inspections is consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations, and that each test and/or inspection is thoroughly documented. Safety and good health are of primary importance to the management and employees of I-K-I Manufacturing.\n\nThe Edgerton I-K-I facility is complying with the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard (PSM), Title 29 CFR 1910.119, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of highly hazardous materials. In this way we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n \nOur PSM enables the facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, the PSM prevents accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoids physical property and environmental damage.\n\nSafety and health considerations, inclu"

Quality control for raw materials and control of hazardous chemical inventory levels.\n\nAdministrative controls include: smoking is prohibited on all I-K-I property and clothing of personnel in production areas must be at least 65% cotton to reduce the occurrence of static electric discharge. These administrative controls are in place because of the flammable nature of most of our processes.\n\nEngineering controls range from facility layout, to the design of the buildings and processes to codes and standards, such as: NFPA, ANSI, ASME, ASTM, and API. Processes are designed to include process area detectors, interlocks, and emission abatement systems, where appropriate.\n\nOur operating procedures describe tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken. Our procedures are technically accurate, understandable to employees, and revised periodically to ensure that they reflect current operations.\n\nThe employee training program at our facility helps our employees understand the nature and the causes of problems that may arise from process operations; our program helps reduce the number and the severity of incidents arising from process operations.\n\nThe intent of our training program is to increase employee awareness of process hazards that are associated with a particular process.
