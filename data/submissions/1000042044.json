The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nAntonio Leal, Water Plant Superintendent, is the responsible official at the Edinburg Pump Station No. 1. The Pump Station No. 1 is located at 2100 West Sprague Street, Edinburg, Hildalgo County, Texas. A one-ton chlorine container with a tank mounted vacuum regulator is on continuous operation, while another one-ton chlorine container serves as a backup. The chlorine containers, situated outside, have manual shutoff valves in case of emergency, and a chlorine alarm triggers if a release occurs. Emergency air supply and power are available for emergencies. Plant operators check the facility every four hours. A self-contained-breathing-apparatus (SCBA) is stored in the West Tower, approximately 65? from the chlorine containers.\n\n\n\nThe offsite conseque"

The EPA defines Atoxic endpoint@ as 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine. This value corresponds to the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentrations, which the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) defines as:\n\n\n\nAThe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual=s ability to take protection action.@\n\n\n\nThe estimated population potentially affected by the release equals the residential population within the radius of a circle corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\n\n\n\nThe following conditions define the Worst-Case Release Scenario at the Edinburg Pump Station No. 1:\n\n\n\n$    Failure of a 1-ton container resulting in the total release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine;\n\n\n\n$    Release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes;\n\n\n\n$    Use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint;\n\n\n\n$    Consideration of the population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance; and\n\n\n\n$    EPA mandated meteorological conditions, specifically an F atmospheric stability class, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec., and an air temperature of 77?
