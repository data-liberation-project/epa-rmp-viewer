Facility Information.\n\n   - The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutruient for crop\n     production.  \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 560,000 pounds in the storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n\n3.  Accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The Facility is in compiance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),\n     29CFR190.11, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and the State of Michigan  code\n     R408.17801 (Revised June 2000) Paragraph (1910.111).\n     The OSHA standard is refrenced in this RMP registration form, see section 8.3(b).        \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n   a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n   - Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge,  \n     have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or  \n     environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency action  program.\n\n   a. The facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.\n       This is the hazardous material plan developed and maintained by our Local Emergency Planning\n       Committee (LEPC).\n\n   b.
