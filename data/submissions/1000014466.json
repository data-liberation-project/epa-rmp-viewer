Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  \n\n\n\nMany of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Diamond Fruit to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates many safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\n \n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\nA?     Diamond Fruit stores and packs fruit, such as pears, cherries and apples.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of our fruit.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\nA?     The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nA?     The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 25,540 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  There is no "

Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView 5 (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nDiamond Fruit complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.\n\n\n\nDiamond FruitA?s written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  \n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.  This "

Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.\n\n\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at Diamond Fruit in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDiamond Fruit has a written Emergency Response Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Response regulations, OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\n\nA?     Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n\nA?     Evacuation Plans and Assembly Points\n\nA?     Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\nAll Diamond Fruit personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.70 Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with codes and standards applicable at that time.\n\n\n\nMock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify elements requiring improvement.\n\n\n\n"
