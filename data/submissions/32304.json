      "SummaryText": "The City of Edinburg Water Filtration Plant accidental release prevention policy approach integrates technologies, procedured, and management practices. The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.\n\nThe City of Edinburg's Water Filtration Plant is located at 500 East Mahl, Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas. Its chlorination building sits on the south side of the plant and consists of a ten-by-ten foot room with two, one-ton chlorine cylinders next to the building and facing north. One cylinder is operational and the other used for backup. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of released chlorine. Personnel oversee the facility twenty-four hours a day, including daily inspections of the Chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage occupies locations in the office and workroom approximately 100 and 200 feet, respectively, for the chlorination building.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Edinburg's Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility's emergency response program. Both departments are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notificaton plan. Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually."
