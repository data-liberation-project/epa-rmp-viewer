MUPB is responsible for the water treatment plant operation that serves 3500 water customers and was constructed in 1968.  The water supplied by the Water Treatment Plant is purified in accordance with rules and regulations of the Kentucky Division of Water.  The water treatment plant uses and ACTLIFO&reg; water clarification process with pre- and post- chlorination.  The water quality is closely monitored at the water treatment plant with the latest in monitoring technology and control equipment.\r\n\r\n\tThe water treatment plant uses chlorine gas to disinfect the raw water prior to delivery to the community.  The maximum quantity of chlorine in storage is 6,000 pounds contained in three one-ton cylinders.  MUPB has implemented written programs and has conducted periodic training and program inspections to insure that the preventive measure needed to safely manage and use chlorine are practiced.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\tSince its startup in 1968, the water treatment plant has not had any accidents resulting in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  MUPB believes that our chemical accident preparedness and prevention programs with regard to chlorine have been significant contributor to our safety record to date.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the water plant:\r\n\tThe top priority of water delivery by MUPB is worker and community safety and environmental stewardship.  To that end, MUPB continues to work closely with local and state agencies to implement programs as required by federal, state, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\tMUPB is committed to operating the chlorine system in a saf"

Upon notification of a release of chlorine gas by MUPB, local officials will implement the appropriate protective actions identified in the city emergency response plan and in the plant emergency operation plan (EOP).  Based on the event, these actions may include evacuation, shelter in place, or no action.  Evacuation of threatened areas will be conducted in conformance with the EOP.  The response time to an incident at this facility by police, fire, and ambulance should not be over 10 minutes.  An evacuation radius of 2.2 miles was determined through the use of the EPA's RMP* Comp software.
