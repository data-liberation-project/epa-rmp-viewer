Experience has shown that actions taken during an emergency are seldom effective unless planned in advance.  \r\n\r\nIt is imperative that plans to accomplish evacuation quickly, efficiently and safely have been developed and communicated to all employees.\r\n\r\nThe Champaign Distribution Center is a food distribution warehouse supplying frozen foods perishables and dry goods to over 300 retail grocery stores in a five-state area.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cooler and freezer rooms in a quantity of 29,320 lbs.  The worst-case scenario would be if the largest vessel ruptured, releasing 12,400 lbs into the atmosphere.  To prevent this from happening the engine room is equipped with emergency ventilation.  A master shut off button is located at the gatehouse outside of the facility as well.  This release would affect a 1.5-mile radius with a population of 7600 residents.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia system piping has been relocated outside above the roof to eliminate exposure.  The Champaign Distribution Center is covered by OSHA's PSM rule.  We are dedicated to the prevention of catastrophic releases and minimizing the consequences of such release.  Employee involvement, education and training are conducted on a regular basis to maintain employee understanding and awareness of PSM information.  The Champaign Distribution Center has not had ANY reportable accident history in the last five years. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program of the Champaign Distribution Center has been developed and coordinated with the LEPC, ESDA and the Champaign / Urbana HAZMAT Teams.  A copy of the ammonia system blueprints have been given to the Teams to give them a working knowledge of our system.  The employees are trained in their initial orientati"

The Distribution Center conducts two emergency evacuation drills on an annual basis.  \r\n\r\nAny release that registers 250 PPM will result in immediate notification 911.  The Champaign / Urbana HAZMAT Teams will respond to the call.  The facility maintains a \"Telephone Tree\" which is put into effect in the event of an emergency, to notify the community.  An on-site medical facility is staffed by a nurse and will be available to assist with any injuries.  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan, which is reviewed by employees and management annually."
