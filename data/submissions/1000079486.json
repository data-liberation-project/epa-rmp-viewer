As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Four Star Fruit has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Four Star Fruit, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Four Star Fruit has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nWest Process                 Anhydrous Ammonia                71,000\n\nEast Process                 Anhydrous Ammonia                39,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals.

In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receivers directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporators and is returned to the main suction accumulators.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the evaporator coils, the system includes a plate and frame heat exchanger. Low temperature liquid is piped from one flooded accumulator to the plate and frame heat exchanger where it flows through the channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the water/glycol mixture on the opposite side of each plate. As the liquid refrigerant absorbs heat, it vaporizes into a low temperature gas which returns to the supplying accumulator and is piped back to the main suction accumulators. \n\n\n\nAny remaining liquid in the main suction accumulators falls to the bottom of the vessels and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Four Star Fruit's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nFour Star Fruit has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date.
