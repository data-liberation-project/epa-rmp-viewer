Founded in 1962, COIM specializes in polycondensation, polyaddition (polyurethane) products and many other chemical specialties.  The quality, variety and extensive nature of its products range, makes Coim one of the major producers in its field.\r\n\r\nCoim operates worldwide through a network of manufacturing sites, sales offices and agencies. Its workforce is dedicated to support guarantee of quality and service, ensuring flexibility and efficiency necessary from an important global industrial organization.\r\n\r\nRegulatory Overview\r\n\r\nThe covered process is subject to the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) (same as EPA Risk Management Program) as well as OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) due to the presence of a toxic (Toluene Diisocyanate) material in the process.  Other major New Jersey regulatory programs that affect the overall site include:  Discharge Prevention Control and Countermeasures (DPCC) Plan, Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SPPP), and air permitting.\r\n\r\nStationary Source Description\r\n\r\nThere is one storage tank, three reactors and a number of 55 gallon drums in a warehouse.\r\n\r\nCovered Process Overview\r\n\r\nThe basic process is to make a polyurethane adhesive or elastomer product.  The basic chemistry is as follows:\r\n\r\n\t\tPolyols + Isocyanate = Polyurethane Elastomer or Adhesive\r\n\r\nVarious temperatures, processing times and trace ingredients will vary the final component mix and specifications.  Ethyl Acetate will be used in the adhesive formulations as an added process ingredient.  \r\n\r\nThe name Polyols refers to chemical compounds containing multiple hydroxyl groups such as dipropylene glycol.  Various blends of 2, 4 and 2, 6 isomers of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) are used in the production of adhesives. The reactive ingredients in a typical system with TDI"

Higher temperatures will cause product quality failure and not a safety issue. \r\n\r\nThe origin of polyurethane dates back to the beginning of World War II where it is was first developed as a replacement for rubber. The versatility of this new organic polymer and its ability to substitute for scarce materials, spurred numerous applications. During World War II, polyurethane coatings were used for the impregnation of paper and the manufacture of airplane finishes and corrosion resistant coatings to protect metal, wood and masonry. \r\nBy the end of the war, polyurethane coatings were being manufactured and used on an industrial scale and could be custom formulated for specific applications. By the mid-50's, polyurethanes could be found in coatings and adhesives, elastomers and rigid foams. It was not until the late 1950's, that comfortable cushioning flexible foams were commercially available. With the development of a low-cost polyether polyol, flexible foams opened the door to the upholstery and automotive applications we know today. \r\nFormulations, additives and processing techniques continued to be developed such as reinforced and structural moldings for exterior automotive parts and one-component systems. Today, polyurethanes can be found in virtually everything we touch - our desks, chairs, cars, clothes, footwear, appliances, beds, and the insulation in our walls, roof and moldings on our homes. \r\nAn Inherently Safer Technology (IST) review was done for these processes.  No further risk reduction measures were identified.\r\n\r\nGeneral Surroundings/Potential Public Receptors\r\n\r\nThere are no potential public or environmental receptors within the expected TDI consequence impact area.

By NJDEP TCPA rules no further risk reduction efforts are required because these events are deemed too unlikely to occur.\r\n  \r\nThe only remaining alternate case scenarios are categorized into hose failures and human error (such as speared drums or adding water to a drum).  Their likelihood is less than once in every 100 years and may have a total release of 50 to 300 gallons in a contained area.\r\n\r\nThe hose is based on the best available design and materials of construction.  Hoses are inspected upon each use and are monitored during all operational uses.  Hoses are used in these cases because of the need for a flexible connection and their use has been minimized.    The expansion of TDI based processes will tend to further minimize hoses in the future by using solid pipelines instead.  \r\n\r\nThe same analysis applies to the other human error based scenarios.  The use of drums will be minimized in the future due to the use of piped connections and will hence reduce overall risk.\r\n \r\nAll available risk reduction measures have been implemented.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe site has an emergency response plan that deals with Toluene Diisocyanate and has been coordinated with local authorities.\r\n\r\n5-year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years, there have been no accidental releases of Toluene Diisocyanate from the West Deptford facility which meet the reporting requirements described in the RMP or NJDEP TCPA regulations.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nThe facility resolves recommendations from HAZOPS  and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modification to the plant design and operating procedures.
