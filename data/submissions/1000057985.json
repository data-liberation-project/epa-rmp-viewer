We will maintain a safety and health program that conforms to the best practices of organizations similar to ours.  The objective of our safety and health program is to surpass the best experience of operations similar to ours.  Our goal is for every employee to embrace the \"zero-injury\" philosophy; that is, every accident that causes an injury or illness is preventable, and no accidents are acceptable to us.  \n\nOur preventative measures start prior to the introduction of any new chemical entering the facility.  Changes are reviewed at several levels including safety and environmental impacts.  Emphasis is placed on characterizing all incoming materials to determine the protective measures necessary to safely store and handle the material. No chemical substance enters or leaves our facility without written information that provides the hazardous properties and safe handling precautions for the substance.  Our storage and processing equipment is designed to safely contain and handle the materials used.  Design data and process evaluations are reviewed at multiple levels to ensure their completeness.  Our ongoing programs to inspect, maintain, and improve our processes are a testament to 3V's commitment to keep our employees, the surrounding community, and the environment safe.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe 3V Sigma USA Inc. facility is located adjacent to the Sampit River, approximately 4.0 miles west of Highway 17 South on Woodstock Road in Georgetown County, South Carolina. The core business is dedicated to the batch production of organic specialty chemicals.  Customers range from the cosmetics industry to paper and pulp manufacturers. \n\n\n\nOur manufacturing scheme is"

Various additives and solid materials are sometimes loaded into the reactors via portals or dump chutes.  The mixture is then reacted by manipulation of temperatures and pressures in the reaction vessel.  The resulting mixture is then transferred to downstream equipment where mechanical operations such as filtering, drying, and packaging are performed.  Any unreacted material is then recovered for reuse or treated and removed.  In general, the storage, transfer, and reaction steps are the most critical in terms of safety.  The majority of our final products are non-hazardous.\n\n\n\n3V stores five raw materials that are covered chemicals under the RMP program. These include acetaldehyde, acrylonitrile, ethylene diamine, sulfur trioxide and vinyl acetate. All materials are stored and processed in closed systems with protective alarms and features. Through careful planning and controls, acetaldehyde has been handled safely for over 12 years. The vinyl acetate system has been safely handled for over 28 years.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario For Process 1:\n\nThe worst case toxic release scenario for vinyl acetate was evaluated.  This scenario involved the failure of the larger of two storage tanks on site containing vinyl acetate.  The storage tank for vinyl acetate is located outside in a concrete containment structure.  EPA's model, RMPComp, was used to evaluate the distances to the toxic end points. The toxic endpoint for this release is offsite and potentially impacts residential receptors.\n\n\n\nAlternate Toxic Release Scenario For Process 1:\n\nThe alternate toxic release scenario was evaluated for vinyl acetate.

Again, the end points of such an event extend beyond the facility boundary but do not reach any receptors. The closest house is more than five times the distance from the facility as the worst case end point.  The alternate release scenario for this material is a release from the same vessel, but assumes that the tank is half full and the failure of the tank is through a 3-inch opening.  In this case the distance to an end point is within the facility boundary. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario For Process 2:\n\nThe worst case toxic release scenario for sulfur trioxide was evaluated.  This scenario involved the failure of the storage tank, which contains the maximum total inventory of sulfur trioxide in the vessel and for the site.

Smoking is prohibited throughout the facility.  Hot work must be conducted by permit only and not in the presence of combustible materials.  Process equipment and storage tanks containing flammable liquids are grounded and inerted with nitrogen and equipped with flame arrestors.  Oxidizers and organic peroxides are segregated from combustible and flammable liquids.  Signs are posted at the entrance to the facility prohibiting smoking, matches or open flames.  Facility personnel inspect process vessels, pumps and piping systems routinely for leaks. Temperatures, pressures and levels are monitored at appropriate intervals on tanks and process equipment. Containment structures exist around tanks and process units containing hazardous materials to contain spills should they occur.  These structures are inspected routinely and deficiencies are addressed as they are discovered.  Storage tanks containing flammable or toxic liquids are provided with nitrogen blankets to remove oxygen, vent controls to avoid over or under pressurization, and safety devices to protect the tank from failure.  Structural integrity of vessels, piping systems and tanks is determined by the presence or absence of visible leaks during visual inspections each shift as well as from scheduled non destructive thickness testing at recommended intervals.\n\n\n\nThe acetaldehyde, acrylonitrile, eth"

As \"covered\" chemicals, their use is evaluated for safety from loading and storage to final processing.  Hazard studies have been performed for all equipment, procedures, and monitoring systems related to the handling of these chemicals.  3V's Process Safety Management program is fully implemented to prevent releases of these substances by incorporating the following features: 1) hazard identification,  2) protective measures, 3) procedures written to empha correct handling and operation, 4) control systems, 5) periodic equipment inspection and maintenance, and 6) training of all personnel associated with hazardous processes.  \n\n\n\nThe storage systems for acetaldehyde, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate are designed to meet NFPA requirements for flammable liquids.  These guidelines assure that the tanks will not over-pressurize under emergency conditions. Some of the specific methods that we use for accident prevention include the following:\n\n* Inerting - oxygen is purged from tanks, pipes, and process equipment with nitrogen to eliminate the potential for a flammable atmosphere.  Under inert conditions, flammable vapors cannot ignite.\n\n* Grounding - storage and process systems are grounded and tested to prevent static discharges, which are a potential ignition source.\n\n* Venting - storage tanks and process vessels have emergency venting systems to prevent vessel ruptures, explosions, and structural damage in an over-pressure situation.\n\n* Alarms - storage tanks and process vessels have various alarms to warn personnel when an operating parameter (i.e. level, temperature, pressure) has deviated out of its safe range. \n\n* Temperature Control - Acetaldehyde is stored at reduced temperature to reduce its vapor pressure, thereby reducing the likelihood of a significant vapor release from the storage and transfer syst"

This is a testament to our ability to safely handle these materials without risk to off site populations.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n3V Sigma USA Inc. (3V) has a complete Emergency Response Plan (Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned release of hazardous materials to the air, soil, or surface water.  The plan is organized into two sections. The first section consists of general information about the 3V facility, preparedness and prevention, training requirements, how the emergency organization is established, coordinating with outside agencies and implementation of the plan in an emergency situation.  The second section is the working document containing specific information needed in an emergency such as telephone numbers of emergency response personnel and off-site responders, notification and emergency procedures, and lists and locations of safety and emergency equipment.  \n\n\n\n3V's Emergency Response Plan is provided to and reviewed with local emergency response agencies and it is included in the Georgetown County Emergency Response Plan.  In addition, 3V has provided to the LEPC and the local fire department information on the facility's hazardous chemical inventory.
