Risk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1) The Facility Policy.  The management and employees of Farmers Union Coop Oil Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, this company is prepared to work with the local emergency agencies and authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2)  Facility Information - The primary activity of the facility is the storage and sale for anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer to the area farmers.  It is received, stored and distributed from this facility.  The maximum quantity stored would be 74,880 pounds in a 18,000 gallon pressurized storage tank.  \n\n3) The Pre-prescribed Release Scenarios\n\n a. The first pre-prescribed release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum release quantity would be 74,880 pounds which represents 85% of the storage tank's volume as limited by its design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.1 miles.  \n\nb. The second pre-prescribed release scenario is based on the event of a release due to a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.36 miles.  \n\n4)  The accidental release prevention program.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  \n\n5)  The 5-year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, inj"

We are consistently striving to improve safety of the facility.  Periodically, evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions for our employees and the surrounding residents.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
