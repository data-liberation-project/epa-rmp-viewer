This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nBrazos Midstream Operating, LLC owns and operates the Comanche Plant, a natural gas processing plant, located in Reeves County, Texas.  The facility has two separate and distinct plants that are each RMP-regulated processes. Comanche is a natural gas processing plant that receives unprocessed natural gas from pipelines, which has gathered the gas from its producer's facilities.  The plant utilizes a cryogenic recovery process removing natural gas liquids for fractionation.  The Comanche Plant delivers the final product via pipeline.  The regulated flammable substances identified at the facility are NGL, propane and unstabilized condensate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Comanche\n\nPlant.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Comanche Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Comanche Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the Comanche Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe Comanche Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific employees within the Comanche Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings form these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Comanche Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Comanche Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Comanche Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) supply contractors with a process overview, (6) information about safety and health hazards, (7) emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Comanche Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Comanche Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nThe Comanche Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment function as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Comanche Gas\n\nPlant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Comanche Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nThe Comanche Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Change are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nBrazos Midstream Operating, LLC promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents i"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Brazos Midstream Operating, LLC periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Comanche Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are traced until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. Summary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis Findings The processes at the Comanche Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations. \n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities:\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously applies to all EPA RMP covered processes at the Comanche Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features:\n\nThe Comanche Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release,\n\n(2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.
