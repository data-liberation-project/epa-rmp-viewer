      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) for the Hillsboro, Forest Grove, Beaverton, Tualatin Valley Water District Joint Commission Water Treatment Plant, hereafter referred to as the Water Treatment Plant, which handles a substance regulated in the Code  of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Appendix A.\n\n1. Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is managed and operated by City of Hillsboro personnel.  The regulated substance handled is chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the US EPA.\n\nGaseous chlorine is stored in 1 ton cylinders located in the facility chlorine storage room.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 12,0000 lbs. (6 tons).\n\n2. Accidental Release & Emergency Prevention Program\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant takes a systematic proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chlorine.  The plant is strictly covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  The prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle chlorine, the safety equipment systems designed and constructed in the facility, and the training of personnel.  The RMP/PSM manual, Hazard Communication Program,  and other various safety programs are kept in the main control room for employee access and  review.\n\nEngineering controls have been added as part of the prevention program to limit the distances for each of the submitted scenarios.  The Water Treatment Plant has installed a chlorine scrubber which is designed to capture and treat the contents of an entire one-ton cylinder.  The system is also under a vacuum regulator that would cut off flow if a leak in the chlorine piping should occur. \n\n3. Worst Case Scenario  & Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant used the ALOHA computer program for its chlorine release scenarios.  The American Water Works Association (AWWA) Research Foundatio"

      "FacilityID": 26803,
      "SummaryText": "n provided a guidance manual with scenarios for both worst case and alternate using ALOHA modeling for chlorine.\n\nChlorine Worst Case:  The failure due to a corrosion, impact or construction defect for a filled a one-ton cylinder would release 2000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration at 200 pounds per minute.  The Water Treatment Plant is located in a rural environment, therefore the distance to end point would be approximately 3 miles.\n\nChlorine Alternate Scenario:  Assuming a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure, a release of a one-ton cylinder at a 60 minute duration would release 317 pounds over a distance to endpoint of 0.56 miles.  This scenario is the most credible with the greatest distance to endpoint.\n\n4. Emergency Response Program\n\nAlthough an accidental chlorine release is unlikely, the Water Treatment Plant has prepared for such a release as well as other emergencies.  The plant has developed an emergency action plan that complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. The written plan incorporates the Forest Grove Fire Department Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan.  In the event of an emergency, key personnel will perform critical tasks to ensure proper containment and/or plant shut down, then evacuate the premises or shelter in place, as deemed appropriate by the acting Incident Commander. \n\nA chemical emergency would involve the Regional Hazardous Material Response Team, which will be summoned by Forest Grove Fire Department when necessary.  Incident Command will remain with the Fire Department.  Training exercises are planned with the cooperation of the Forest Grove Fire Department\u00bfs Training Officer. \n\n5. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere have been no major unresolved process hazards identified in the chlorine system at the Water Treatment Plant."
