      "SummaryText": "Cargill Meat Solutions - Columbus, NE primary business is processing wholesale distribution of meat products for human consumption. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP was modified in July 2016 due to a plant processing remodel. The processing change increased the total onsite inventory of ammonia. \n\n\n\nFacility release modeling was performed using EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp and ALOHA. The worst-case scenario is based on a pipe rupture from the High Pressure Receiver. Other alternate cases were considered, including vessel overfilling, over pressurization scenarios, pipe ruptures and material handling and transfer hoses. \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on a Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) lifting on a vessel, the PRV chosen was that of the highest flow capacity.  No passive or administrative controls were considered for the release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/ RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility"

      "SummaryText": " has an emergency action plan in place and conducts periodic response drills and coordinates with the local fire department and LEPC. The facility is committed to continually improving safety through program implementation and execution. The facility has never experienced a release incident that meets the EPA's 5 Year Accident Reporting criteria involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The main floor system shutdown can be manually operated using a switch located outside the engine room.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan in place to provide a plan of action for the on-site hazmat team. A hazmat team is available on site to respond to emergency releases. The facility also coordinates District 4 LEPC to respond to emergency releases. The facility is included in the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe Cargill Meat Solutions facility is continuously working to improve process safety at the facility. Facility practices to improve safety include:\n\n- Internal audits are completed regularly to verify RMP program viability\n\n- Facility tours are offered to District 4 LEPC on a regular basis.\n\n- There are recurring PSM meetings that are held with the employees at the facility to discuss suggestions for improvements to the RMP plan.\n\n -Annual PSM training is completed with all Cargill employees at the facility.\n\n- New hire employees receive PSM orientation training during their initial training period.\n\n- Recently hired a PSM Coordinator\n\n\n\n"
