      "SummaryText": "Bridgeport Fuel Cell Park Executive summary\n\nDominion Bridgeport Fuel Cell Park (BFCP) power production facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut is owned by Dominion Bridgeport Fuel Cell, LLC and operated by FuelCell Energy, Inc.  BFCP electrochemically converts pipeline supplied natural gas into electricity.  The by-products of the electrochemical process are exhaust gases and waste heat.  The waste heat is used to generate additional electrical power.  Electricity generated by BFCP is distributed to customers through the electrical grid.  \n\nBFCP also employs an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) energy converter (OEC) to capture energy from waste heat and use it to generate additional electric power.  A circulating hot oil system transfers heat from the fuel cells to the OEC. The OEC uses pentane as a binary working fluid in the power cycle.  The equipment containing pentane is centrally located in a small area and includes a pre-heater, vaporizer, turbine, recuperator, condenser, process pump, and interconnecting piping.  The heated pentane vapor spins a turbine, which in turn drives an electric generator.  The Organic Rankine Cycle is a closed loop process.  The BFCP maximum inventory of pentane is 11,800 lb.  The pentane covered process is subject to both RMP Program Level 3 and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.\n\nThe normally unmanned site is continuously operated and monitored 24 hours a day from a remote operations facility.  Operations personnel also routinely perform inspection rounds of the site several times a week.  If necessary, maintenance and operating personnel can be dispatched to the site within a 2 hour response time.  Other measures to prevent, contain, or detect a pentane release include: manual and remote shutdown capability, well-designed relief systems; spill containment structure, pentane gas detection sensors, and flame detectors.\n\nFCE / BFCP has a corporate commitment to worker and public safety as demonstrated by the resources invested "

      "SummaryText": "in accident prevention, throughout the design, operation and maintenance of the process systems and through intensive training of all operating and maintenance personnel.  FCE policy for BFCP is to implement all reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of pentane.  FCE / BFCP operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail to safety.  Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written operational and maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the process equipment and emergency shutdown systems. These activities include continuous monitoring of operational parameters, periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices.  Any changes to the OEC processes or plant equipment are subjected to a formalized Management of Change process review and appropriate updates to the hazard analysis.  Process safety information is incorporated into operational procedures, and pre-startup safety reviews are completed, prior to implementing any operational changes. \n\nAudits and inspections are performed periodically to identify changes to improve safety. These changes are evaluated and implemented as required by regulation.  Safety training through first aid, Emergency Action Plan, Hazard Communication, PPE, and other programs reinforce the criticality of chemical and process safety to operations personnel.  Operations personnel conduct inspections routinely to minimize the risk of potential leaks or process problems.  The emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, emergency horns, evacuation, and summoning of local emergency first responders.  FCE / BFCP have coordinated with the Bridgeport Fire Department, the Bridgeport Local Emergency Planning Council and other local first responders.  An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38 is in place. The Bridgeport Fuel Cell Park was commissi"

The PHA was reconvened in September of 2018 and re-certified on October 5, 2018. In instances where the PHA identified methods to improve safety, they were listed as recommendations in the PHA Report.  Any outstanding recommendations that have been evaluated as beneficial and identified for implementation are addressed as outlined in the PHA action items list.\n\n"
