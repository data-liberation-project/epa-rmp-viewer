The requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H.  Under the ARP Program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities have applicable requirements.\n\nCrompton Corporation manufactures fatty acids, emulsifiers, derivatives, amines and amides at its Memphis Plant.  Crompton Memphis stores ammonia, a listed toxic substance, in excess of the threshold quantity in several storage tanks; thus the facility is subject to the ARP Program.  In addition, methyl chloride, a listed flammable substance, is stored in excess of the EPA's threshold quantity.\n\nThe Crompton Memphis Plant (CMP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  In both Crompton's written Safety and Environmental Policies, \"Safety is unequivocally our number one priority\".   CMP has implemented reasonable controls to prevent probable releases of hazardous chemicals.\nShould a release occur, trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n1.1   Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nCrompton's Memphis Plant is an Oleo-Chemical processing facility located at 1231 Pope Street in Memphis, Tennessee.  The plant is situated on approximately 42+ acres in north Memphis.  The immediate area surrounding CMP are occupied by the Central Illinois Railroad to the North; several different warehouses to the East; a personal care / pharmaceutical M"

      "SummaryText": "anufacturer to the South; and, a printing company and another chemical company to the West.\n\nOleo-chemicals have been processed at this site since the late 1950s.  Crompton's Memphis Plant makes a variety of Oleo-Chemical and Derivatives that are sold to the food, cosmetic, plastic, and rubber industries.  The facility is operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Manufacturing activity at the site requires approximately 360 employees.  Plant manufacturing can be broken down into five areas: Enenco, Stearates, Derivatives, Northwest Processing and Northeast Processing.  Even during holiday periods, at least one salaried production leader and hourly chemical plant operators operate or maintain the plant.\n\nOne of the major product lines operated within our Enenco Department is the Nitrile system.  Fatty acids are pumped from the tank farm and reacted with ammonia and catalyst to form nitriles.  An actual reaction of the ammonia is done under pressure in one of two process reactors.  Anhydrous ammonia is supplied from a tank (D-11) that is administratively controlled to 47,000 pounds or less in capacity.\n\nCrompton Memphis Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) maximum of 10,000 pounds threshold quantity.  The CMP evaluation indicated that anhydrous ammonia would present the largest concern to the community in the unlikely event of an off-site excursion. \n\n\n2.0   Hazard Assessment\n\n2.1   Chemical Quantities and Processes\n\n\nThe \"List Rule\" (see 40 CFR 68, Subpart F and Table 1 to ?68.130) identifies threshold quantities for purposes of applicability to the ARP Program.  Based on process knowledge, Crompton Memphis identified the regulated substances and the quantities stored on site.  The facility uses several regulated substances in many separate processes.

A realistic alternative release is analyzed for each regulated toxic substance and one alternative release is analyzed for all flammable substances.   Crompton Memphis Plant (CMP) has identified ammonia, ethylene diamine, formaldehyde, hydrogen and methyl chloride as being stored on plant above the threshold quantities.  Hydrogen and methyl chloride are the two flammables evaluated for offsite consequence analysis.  The purpose of the worst and alternate case analysis is to determine the distance from the Crompton Memphis Plant (CMP) to the toxic or flammable endpoints.\n\nThe EPA has prepared lookup tables in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance for determining distances to the toxic and flammable endpoints.  In addition to the lookup tables, computer software which incorporates current knowledge on Chemical Release Modeling (CRM) was utilized to construct air dispersion models in order to estimate "

These procedures, in conjunction with site safety rules and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. Chapter 9 of the Memphis Plant's PSM/RMP manual provides more detail regarding the plant's safety permit (hot work, linebreaking, confined space entry) program.\n\n\n1.4.10  Management of Change\n\nCrompton Memphis has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. Chapter 1 of the Memphis Plant's PSM/RMP manual provides in depth detail regarding employee participation in the facility's compliance plan. Chapter 10 of the Memphis Plant's PSM/RMP manual provides a sample of the facility's MOC form and describes in greater detail exactly how the program functions.\n\n\n1.1.11   Incident Investigation\n\nCrompton promptly investigates all incidents that res"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, root cause(s) and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards their report to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including  contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. Chapter 11 of the Memphis Plant's PSM/RMP manual provides a description of the facility's incident investigation policy and procedure.\n\n\n1.4.12   Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Crompton Corporation periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the Plant PSM/RMP Committee for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n1.5.1   Universal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevent program summarized previously is applied to all processes and areas at the Memphis Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n1.5.2   Specialized Safety Features\n\nCrompton Memphis has safety devices on many units to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) mitigate the consequences of a release.  The following type of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Containment / Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that prevent overpressurization and a subsquent discharge.\n2. Valves that permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n3. Automated fog spray system to minimize ammonia cloud formation\n4. Check valves in piping to prevent free flow of hazardous materials\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire extinguishers\n2. Fire monitor spray system for ammonia tank\n3. Use of offsite emergency response personnel located within 5 minutes of the site.\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n1.6   Five-Year Accident History\n\nCrompton Memphis has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release as defined within 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n1.7   Emergency Response Program Information\n\nCrompton Memphis maintains a written incident response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment during an emergency.
