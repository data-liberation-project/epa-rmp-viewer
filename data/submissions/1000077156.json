The facility is located at 650 Regal Row, Dallas, TX 75247. The SIC code for the operation is 4222; the NAICS code is 493120. The facility operates 24 hours/day, 6 days/week, 52 weeks/year. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe facility has not experienced any reportable releases or releases meeting the 5 year accident history criteria for inclusion in the RMP submittal. Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures. The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and a Risk Management Program (RMP) required by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR 68. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.

The PSM/RMP program is reviewed periodically and updated as necessary. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\nThe system is monitored 24 hours per day and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program. The system is inspected periodically for proper operation. Walking inspections are conducted throughout the day. System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected. The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room. The system shutdown can be manually operated using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia. The facility conducts periodic incident response drills. The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or offsite injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place. Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\n\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department"

The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA. The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia. A release of 100 pounds or more must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA. The Fire Department will be provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan as part of our emergency coordination efforts.\n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation - Labatt Food Service continually works to safely manage the hazards of anhydrous ammonia to protect the community we serve and the employees working for us. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis, and coordinate with the community emergency response organization.\n\n"
