One of the major ingredients of the raw material is toluene diisocyanate (TDI) unspecified isomer CAS# 26471-62-5.  TDI is the only acutely hazardous material (AHM) used in the production.  The established State Threshold Quantity for TDI unspecified isomer is not listed, but toluene-2,4-diisocyanate is 500 pounds and that of toluene-2-6-diisocyanate is 100 pounds.  The established StateToxic endpoint is .0070 mg/l.\n\nA HAZOP safety team conducted a hazard and operability (HAZOP) study on October 25, 1995.  The team consisted of facility personnel and a third party consultant.  The facility personnel included the plant manager, production crew, maintenance engineer, and quality assurance chemist.  The consultant involved Professional Engineers and Certified Industrial Hygienists.  Mr. Frank Marasa of the Los Angeles County Fire Department attended the entire HAZOP study conducted on October 25, 1995.  The guide word approach was used for HAZOP identification.  The risk matrix algorithms were utilized for hazard ranking.  The existing safeguards for AHM release were identified.  Based upon the HAZOP study, certain control measures were recommended for implementation.\n\nA total of four external event categories were evaluated; they were transportation accidents, fire, flooding, and nearby pipelines.  It was concluded that external events posted no risk to the normal operations in the plant.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis was conducted to evaluate the health and environmental impacts associated with the potential acute impacts of an accident.  Data from the Aloha model, provided from Bayer, determined the worst-case release endpoint distance for TDI releases.  The results are based on the technique described in EPA's Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidance.  In particular, equation D-1 of that guidance document was used to estimate pool evaporation based"

A Gaussian plume model was used to determine the endpoint distance based upon the evaporation rate.\n\nOne worst case scenario was modeled.  The worst case was assumed to be a rupture of the 5,000-gallon TDI storage tank, regardless of its cause or likelihood.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nArnco's facility in South Gate, California produces three main varieties of tire-fill:  Permacor, Re-pneu, and Superflex.  These three products account for over 85 percent of the volume of goods produced at this facility. \n\nThe main building was designed and built in 1951.  The property was leased from Sheldon Angel Enterprises in 1974.  The contact person is Mr. Howard Sheldon or Mr. Luis Angel at (310) 670-0811.  Arnco currently employs 24 people in South Gate, 7 people in production and 17 in the office.  There is only one shift for production between the hours of 6:00 AM to 3:30 PM.  Employees are in the plant from 4:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily Monday to Friday.  Both Schultz and DSL, two immediate neighbors, operate 24 hours a day and have private security and CCTV cameras on the premises.  There is always activity around Arnco.  The South Gate facility is Arnco's headquarters.\n\nArnco's building currently occupies 22,500 ft2 on a 45,000 ft2 lot.  The building is located at 5141 Firestone Place in the City of South Gate, California, approximately 1,700 ft west of the 710 Freeway and 300 ft north of Firestone Boulevard.  As shown in Figure 1.1, Arnco is located in an M-3 heavy manufacturing zone. \n\nTDI is a water-white to pale yellow liquid under room temperature.  The approximate vapor pressure at 200 C is 0.01 mm.  TDI slowly produces CO2 and polyureas when reacted with water.  Inhalation exposure and ingestion of TDI will cause strong irritation to skin and tissue, especially to the eyes.  The current Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) time weighted average (TWA) is"
