The EPA rule is applicable to the St. Cloud WTF because the maximum inventory for chlorine gas is greater than the 2,500-lbs. EPA RMP threshold.  The maximum amount of chlorine gas stored on-site is 18,000-lbs.  \n\n\n\nA requirement of the RMP is a Hazard Assessment of the potential impacts of a worst-case and alternate release scenarios.  An assessment of these scenarios is included with the submittal.  There have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WTF in the last five years.\n\n\n\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent accidental release.  Chlorine gas detectors are in place and checked weekly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas would take place in an enclosed building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  A chlorine scrubber at the St. Cloud WTF is an active mitigation tool that will neutralize a chlorine gas leak.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risk of an accidental release of chlorine gas and prevent injury to the public and WTF employees.  This is accomplished by specifying responsibilities and outlining safety procedures that will prevent and/or contain a chlorine gas release.\n\n\n\nThe City of St. Cloud Water Utility has an Emergency Action Plan to comply with Federal Regulations 40 CFR 1910.38(a).\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Risk Management Plan, the St. Cloud WTF has a written procedure to respond to hazardous "

      "SummaryText": "materials spills including chlorine gas.  The St. Cloud WTF uses a zone system to control and identify the areas of a hazardous material spill.  The zone system assists the Fire and Police Departments with areas of evacuation and hazardous materials containment.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is to ensure the safety and well being of the users of the water system and St. Cloud Public Utilities employees during times of emergency operations.  The plan identifies necessary administrative and employee actions during emergencies.  It does not cover all possible crisis or emergencies that may occur, but the actions indicated in the plan will assist in any type of emergency. \n\n\n\nElements addressed in the EAP include escape procedures and exit routes, critical plant operations, accounting for employees, rescue and medical duties, reporting emergencies, alarm systems and notification of emergencies and types of evacuations.\n\n\n\nThe Public Utilities Administration is committed to safety by providing annual right to know training, bloodborne pathogen training, lock out - tag out and confined space entry procedures.  Administration supports regular Hazard Control Meetings and Monthly City Safety Committee Meetings and provides personal protection equipment to all employees.  The City of St. Cloud will continue to make safety a high priority and is committed to employee training and improving the current safety policies and programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
