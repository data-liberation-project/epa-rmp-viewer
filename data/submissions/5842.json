The CalARP Program satisfies the requirements of the County and the Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act.  Both the HGC facility and the SIGC facility use chlorine in excess of the threshold quantities under 40 CFR Part 68 and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code and Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations.  The SIGC facility also uses isopentane in excess of the threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68 and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code and Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations. Based on the amount of Regulated Substances (RSs) handled at the facilities and the facilities' PSM requirements, both facilities are subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\n\nTo satisfy the CalARP Program requirements, Ogden Geothermal Operations, Inc. is submitting this RMP and CalARP Program.  Ogden Geothermal Operations, Inc. is also submitting a RMP as required under the Federal guidelines using the RMP Submit program.  The program summarizes the processes involving the RSs handled at the facility and the potential hazards associated with the handling of the RSs.  The approach and technical evaluation methods used to review the RS-handling processes and mitigate the potential hazards are also presented. \n\nThis Program is based on a Process Hazards Analysis, Offsite Consequence Analysis, and Seismic Assessment that were completed to evaluate the processes involving the RS.  The Program also documents recommendations arising from the evaluations and a schedule "

In accordance with the RMP program guidelines, the Program contains the following elements:\n\n7 Hazard Assessment, including a worst case analysis, an alternative release analysis, and a five-year accident history;\n7 Management Program, including a document management system;\n7 Prevention Program, including process safety information, a process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, maintenance programs, incident investigation programs, documentation of compliance audits, management of change procedures, pre-startup review, contractor requirements, employee participation programs, and hot work permit requirements; and\n7 Emergency Response Program, including development of a plan and program.\n\nThe facilities are in compliance with the requirements of the CalARP and RMP programs.  They are operated with programs that protect both the workers at the facility and the public from accidental release of RSs.  The facilities have implemented detailed training, maintenance, and inspection programs that serve to prevent releases of an RS.  In the event of a release of either chlorine or isopentane, Ogden Geothermal Operations, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan that provides for the notification of the public and provides steps to mitigate the impacts of a release.\n\nThis RMP and CalARP Program documents all of the required information and provides a summary of Ogden Geothermal Operations, Inc.'s plans and programs to manage risks associated with the handling of chlorine and isopentane at the HGC and SIGC facilities."
