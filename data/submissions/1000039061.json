      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Marathon Ethanol, LLC\n\nGreenville Operations\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n\n\nSite and Process Description\n\n\n\nThe Andersons Marathon Ethanol, LLC Greenville Ethanol Plant is located at 5728 Sebring-Warner Rd. The facility is located north of Sebring-Warner Rd in the city of Greenville which is in Darke County, Ohio.  \n\n\n\nThe Greenville facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 60 people.  The following operations are performed at this facility:  grain receiving and storage;  hammer milling;  fermentation;  distillation, dehydration and evaporation (DDE);  separation;  wet and dry distillers grain and solubles (WDGS / DDGS) drying, storage and shipping;  and ethanol storage and shipping.  \n\n\n\nCorn is stored temporarily in the concrete silos, prior to being fed to four hammer mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area.\n\n\n\nAdditives are incorporated into the process and the product is fermented, creating a beer mash.  The product enters the distillation and condensation process.  The beer is approximately 10% ethanol and 90% non-fermentable corn solids and water.  The ethanol is separated from the beer at this stage and leaves as 190-proof ethanol, which is sent to a bulk storage tank.  The 190-proof contains residual water, so it is then dehydrated, which produces 200-proof ethanol.  Lastly, the 200-proof ethanol is mixed with a denaturant and stored in one of three tanks prior to transferring to the truck or rail loadout areas.  Emissions from the DDGS drying process are controlled through a recuperative thermal oxidizer.\n\n\n\nThe distillation process removes the ethanol from the beer, non-fermentable corn solids and water.  The remaining water is then removed from the residual mash or whole stillage.  The resulting product is called wet distillers grain (WDG).  A small amount of WDG will be maintained as \"wet cake\" - having a moisture content of 65 - 70% -- and"

      "SummaryText": " sold directly to customers as high quality animal feed.  Storage of wet cake is very limited, on the north side of the Energy Center.  The majority of WDG will be dried to approximately 12% moisture.  The resulting product is called dried distillers grain (DDG), which can be stored for extended periods of time in the large barn at the east end of the property.  After leaving the dryers, the DDG is cooled before going to storage.\n\n\n\nThe thermal oxidizer serves as the primary emission control device for the four dryers as well as various process vents.  The thermal oxidizers are very efficient at controlling particulates, carbon monoxide, VOC's, HAP's and nuisance odors.\n\n\n\nThe facility also has a water cooling tower for non-contact cooling water used in the fermentation process and a small fire pump for emergency use.\n\n\n\nRMP Applicability & Chemical Description\n\nThe facility stores and utilizes two chemicals that require participation in the Risk Management Plan.  Those are anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7) and natural gasoline, a flammable mixture, which is used as a denaturant.    \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used to control pH in the fermentation process and it is stored outside in an 18,000 gallon storage tank on the west end of the fermenters. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold up to 15,300 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tank.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard. Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes into contact with mucous membranes, in particular.   Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\n\n\nThe natural gasoline is used to denature the ethanol produced at the facility and is a flammable mixture.

Butane makes up 0.806% of the natural gasoline and pentane makes up 47.715% (neo-Pentane at 0.237%, iso Pentane at 22.96% and n-Pentane (1,2 Butadiene) at 24.518%).  \n\n\n\nNatural gasoline is stored in a 188,000 gallon steel tank in the facility's tank farm.  Secondary containment consisting of a diked structure containing an impermeable liner and gravel overlay, surrounds the tank farm.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAs mentioned above, the storage tank has an 18,000 gallon capacity, but when filled to 85%, it can only hold 15,300 gallons or 85,527 pounds of ammonia.   All deliveries are made by truck, which holds 20 tons (40,000 pounds) of ammonia.  The worst case release scenario would occur while the delivery truck is hooked up to the storage tank during the receiving process.   A truck is only ordered when the storage tank can receive the entire truckload.  So, 85,527 pounds of storage capacity - 40,000 pounds of empty space required to be able to order and receive a truckload of ammonia + 40,000 pound of ammonia on the delivery truck = 85,527 pounds of product that is capable of being released during the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nA complete failure or burst of the ammonia storage tank, as represented by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built in 2006 under strict guidelines established by the ASME pressure vessel code.  The National Board Certificate for the tank is on file.  The storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks or appendages are performed by certified welders and stamped accordingly.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release - Flammable Mixture, Natural Gasoline\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be a total loss of a full tank of natural gasoline resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The storage tank capacity is 188,000 gallons or 1,052,800 pounds"

The most probable time for an exposure to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery truck to the storage tank.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced by the transporter or The Andersons in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are directly observed by the delivery truck driver.  Transfers of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the processing building occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.\n\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances for the alternative scenario, the amount released would not be based on the total volume of both vessels.  Instead, it would be limited by the volume of the delivery truck.  The plumbing at the storage vessel receiving bulkhead has backflow preventers which would prevent the tank from emptying its contents if a transfer hose ruptured.  Therefore, the product that would be released would have to come from the delivery truck.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied by a tanker truck, which holds 20 tons (40,000 pounds) of product.  Product is transferred via rubber hoses to the storage tank at a rate of 1,000 pounds / minute.  The truck has an excess flow valve and the receiving system at the tank also has one.  Typically, a release would immediately trigger the excess flow valves to slam shut.  However, if the release was too slow to trigger the excess flow valve, it would continue to leak until the transfer system could be shut down.  Over the course of a ten minute per"

Deliveries are made by truck and pumped into the storage tank.  Deliveries are typically 9,000 gallons or 50,400 pounds of which 24,455 pounds are butane and pentane.  \n\n\n\nAll deliveries are made during business hours and are observed by the truck driver and facility personnel.

The passive mitigation systems in place include:\n\n?    Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point between the delivery truck and the storage tank plumbing.  If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to shear off from the plumbing.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just inside the breakaway barrier, would prevent the tank from emptying into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place include:\n\n\n\n?    Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on both storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the "

Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\n?    Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing back to the transport tank from the storage tank.\n\n?    Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\n?    There are emergency shutoff valves (\"snappy joes\") on the inlet lines and discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n\n?    An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and a water hydrant to help knock down a vapor cloud.\n\n?    Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n\n?    Delivery truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia.  All hose replacements are documented.

      "SummaryText": " \n\n\n\nCommunication procedures with responders \n\nThe local fire department is invited to tour the facility on an annual basis.  Facility management, employees and fire department personnel have jointly discussed the location of the anhydrous ammonia and response procedures on a regular basis.  They know the location of all emergency shutoff valves and on-site response equipment.  We believe that a strong relationship with first responders is our best defense.\n\n\n\nThe LEPC and state regulatory agencies receive a copy of our hazardous materials storage information, every February, in accordance with our community right to know obligations.  A copy of the Emergency Action Plan is on file with the LEPC and the local fire department.\n\n\n\nSecurity Plans\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) 49 CFR Part 172, requires all facilities that offer or transport hazardous materials to document a security plan and perform employee awareness training.  \n\n\n\nA security assessment plan has been created to describe all security measures at this facility, identify any vulnerable areas and then document the measures taken to address those risks.  The plan is intended to work in conjunction with the Emergency Action and Spill Control Plan to meet all required criteria.\n\n\n\nTraining is performed with all employees annually and within 90 days of employment.\n\n"
