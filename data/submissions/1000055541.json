We are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Wayne County LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\t Facility Information\r\nThe primary activity of this facility is to store and distribute anhydrous ammonia in storage and nurse tanks, for the application and fertilization of agronomic crops.\r\n\r\n3.\t Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with provision of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code January 1, 2016.  The OSHA Standard is referenced in the registration form Section 8.3b.  Additional accidental release prevention measures we utilize range from employee training to equipment maintenance.  We have excess flow valves and pressure relief valves on our ammonia system.  We also have gauges to tell us when these tanks are full to prevent the over filling if these tanks which in turn could create an accidental release.\r\n\r\n4.\t Five year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia or personal injuries in the last five years.  To my knowledge there has been no off-site damage resulting in"

We also follow the Iowa Fertilizer Rule Standards and provide state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  We will notify the local authorities as well as the LEPC if a release occurs.  Our role as the company will be to secure the area until local authorities arrive and assist in any way possible.\r\n\r\n6.     Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  We have implemented new requirements such as installing bulkheads where we receive delivery transports and additional water jump tanks.  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time."
