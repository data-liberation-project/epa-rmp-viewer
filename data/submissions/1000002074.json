The propylene oxide distribution system at the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal is managed/operated/maintained by DOW Chemical under contractual agreement with Lyondell.  There are no Lyondell or Bayer employees located at the North Charleston Distribution Terminal.  Bayer management at the South Charleston Plant provide instruction and direction to the DOW employees/contractors who operate the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal because a majority of the PO is owned by Bayer and is ultimately transferred into the Bayer PO distribution system at the South Charleston manufacturing facility for use by Bayer and DOW Chemical in their manufacturing units.  The PO that is not owned by Bayer is owned by Lyondell. The North Charleston Distribution Terminal facility is treated as a separate stationary source because the Kanawha River separates it from the South Charleston Manufacturing Plant; therefore, it is considered noncontiguous with the South Charleston Plant.  Lyondell ships propylene oxide from the Texas Gulf Coast by barge to the North Charleston Distribution Terminal for storage and subsequent transfer to the South Charleston Plant where it is used in Polyol manufacture by Bayer and as a raw material by DO in several of its manufacturing units. \n\nIn summary the Bayer South Charleston facility has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemical (propylene oxide) and no RMP flammable chemicals.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years with off-site consequences\n\ne.  Facility Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal consists of volunteer emergency response teams from DOW that work rotating shifts and straight days.  The goal is to have 3 \u00c2\u00bf 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the Charleston Fire Department.  The DOW emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  In the case of a significant fire the Charleston Fire department would likely be involved.  The plant also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems through the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC). Community warning sirens are placed in multiple places in the Kanawha Valley and there is one within 1 mile of the plant. \n\nThe Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.
