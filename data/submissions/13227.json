If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The maximum quantity stored would be 260,000 pounds in one-30,000 gallon and three-10,000 gallon tanks.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 260,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85 % capacity as linited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.5 miles.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in the transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
