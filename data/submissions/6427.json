(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Ukiah, CA.  The resin plant was originally constructed in 1974 and employs 24 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Ukiah, CA plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Ukiah Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Ukiah Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the Ukiah Plant.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Ukiah Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the Ukiah Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and"

In fact, the Ukiah Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Ukiah Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Ukiah Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Ukiah Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Ukiah Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Ukiah Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n8.1.a Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These contro"

      "SummaryText": "ls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Ukiah Plant, and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Ukiah Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n8.1.b Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Ukiah Plant handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the federal RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at the plant.\n\nRegulated\nSubstance                             Program Level     Process                Process Quantity*, lbs RMP Threshold, lbs*\nFormaldehyde Solution (50%)   3                      Resin Manufacture 288,000                    15,000\nAqua Ammonia (28%)               3                      Resin Manufacture 20,030                      20,000\n\n* Process and threshold quantity are the quantities of pure chemical, not of the solution\n\n\n8.1.c Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Ukiah Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  GPRI does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the Mendocino County LEPC improve the community emergency response plan"

      "SummaryText": ".  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1)might occur at a facility like the Ukiah Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \n The following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Ukiah Plant:\n \n 8.1.c.1.  The worst-case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the release of K-2 kettle contents after filling.  A concrete diked area contains the released formaldehyde solution which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on modeling is 0.6 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that 431 people live within this distance from the location of the kettle.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance including nearby residences.  No environmental receptors are lo"
