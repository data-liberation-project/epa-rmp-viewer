Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n2.Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient and also used for blending in a mixing operation to make mixed-grade fertilizer for application. The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in the facility's 1 Tank. The capacity of the storage tank is 30,000 gallons.\n3.The worst-case release scenario: Would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company proceedures. The distance of the end point of dispersion based on the model used is 1.16 miles. \nAlternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 26,000 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Deptartment of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 reguarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n5.

The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities, the emergecy planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Titlle III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community reponse planning.\n7.Planned changes to improve safety: Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintaince of safe practies and operations. There are no additional specific anhydros ammonia saftey recommendations for implement at this time."
