Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAll recommendations from PHAs, MOCs, PSRs, mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations, and compliance audits are addressed.  In addition, it is General Mills' policy to review operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable and effective.  This continuous review process generates further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations, but these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.  Summary\r\n\r\nThe design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine system according to The Chlorine Institute standards and guidelines, and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs, provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of chlorine are being managed in an appropriate manner.  The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs.  General Mills has developed an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated through the local response agencies and the information in this Risk Management Plan is communicated to the local community.  General Mills operations management is committed to safety and implementation of safe procedures for Prevention and Preparedness."

      "SummaryText": "ndled\r\n\r\nThe chlorine for the flour milling process at the Kansas City plant is a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.  The chlorine storage and gas delivery system is a closed system and delivers gaseous chlorine to the flour chlorinators under vacuum.  The chlorinating system consists of containers, piping, valves, pumps, flowmeters, and controls.  Full chlorine containers are delivered and empty containers picked up by an outside service.\r\n\r\nA chlorine detector is located in the chlorine container storage room.  A visual alarm for the detector is located in an alarm panel in the mill control room.  A visual alarm is also located on the exterior of the chlorine room.\r\n\r\nThe clorination system reduces the gas pressure from the storage container to near zero, allowing the system to operate in a vacuum.  If a release does occur in the chlorine piping to the chlorinators the flow of chlorine is automatically shut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Release Scenario Analysis\r\n\r\nThe EPA OCA Guidance Reference Tables (RMP*Comp program) and The Chlorine Institute guidance were used to develop the potential off site impacts from various release scenarios.  A worst-case scenario was developed to identify the potential off-site emergency response planning needed with community first responders; however, it is important to empha that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.  On the other hand, the alternative release scenario is based on credible assumptions and was selected from a number of possible scenarios.  The alternate chlorine release scenario would be representative of container delivery pipe, gasket, or valve packing leak in the chlorine storage room.  A chlorine detector is located within the room to automatically start exhaust fans, sound an alarm, and automatically close the container valves (stopping the flow).\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

This is one of the most important ways for preventing chlorine releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur.  Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the chlorine system.  The PSI includes data on the chemicals, equipment, technology, process flow diagrams and P&IDs.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) - An initial PHA was conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements and is re-validated at least every 5 years.  Recommendations made by the most recent PHA team to further improve safety have been addressed.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - Equipment operating and maintenance manuals, in addition to plant specific safe work practices, provide written guidance for chlorine system operations, including safe unloading and handling of chlorine containers.\r\n\r\nTraining - Training is provided for all personnel involved with mill plant (clorinating) operations.  Annual training includes the safe unloading and handling of chlorine, chlorine system operation, and emergency response preparedness.\r\n\r\nMaintenance (Mechanical Integrity) - Equipment inspections, testing, and preventative maintenance activities are scheduled according to manufacturers' recommendations and/or The Chlorine Institute.  The inspections, testing, and preventative maintenance are conducted per contract with a qualified chlorine equipment service company.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure has been developed and is implemented to ensure all changes are adequately reviewed and appropriate sections of the PSM program are updated.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review (PSR) - A PSR policy and procedure has been developed to address startups following equipment or system changes.\r\n\r\nCompli"

Findings from the audit have been addressed.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation policy and procedure has been developed to help determine the root cause of an incident and to help develop measures to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place to ensure employees are aware of the PSM program, the PHA, and its findings.  Employees were involved in the PHA and are trained on the operation of the chlorine system.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit - A hot work permit program has been developed and implemented for hot work conducted in and around the chlorine systems.\r\n\r\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures are in place to ensure the contractor is aware of the hazards involved in the work, and to verify the contractor will follow safe work practices in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no releases of chlorine at the Kansas City facility in the last five years that meet the RMP reporting criteria.\r\n\r\n7.  Emergency Response Preparedness Program\r\n\r\nThe Kansas City plant has a site Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses and neighbors, emergency equipment list, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic exposures to chlorine.  The EAP is coordinated with the Kansas City Fire Department (Hazmat 71) and the Mid-America Regional Council and is consistent with the regional hazmat response plan.  Annual chlorine emergency evacuation and incident response drills are conducted.  Training exercises are conducted with the Hazmat team.\r\n\r\nThe facility has conducted risk management plan communication meetings with employees and has notified immediate offsite receptors."
