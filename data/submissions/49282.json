(Jayhawk), a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa Corporation, owns and operates a batch specialty chemical manufacturing facility near Galena, Kansas.  The industrial area within which Jayhawk\u00bfs property and manufacturing operations are located is known locally as the \u00bfJayhawk Plant\u00bf, dating back to its creation in the 1940\u00bfs. That portion of the Jayhawk Plant Site containing Jayhawk\u00bfs property, buildings and equipment will be referred to hereinafter as the Facility. \nThe Facility is located on approximately 640 acres of a 2,200-acre industrial complex. Jayhawk\u00bfs Unit 1 encompasses approximately 29 acres and Unit 2 encompasses approximately 25 acres. The Facility is located approximately 3.5 miles northwest of the incorporated city of Galena, Kansas, lying 1.5 miles east of U.S. Highway 69 Alternate (69A), in Cherokee County, Kansas, and approximately 3.1 miles north of the junction of Kansas Route 66 and U.S. Highway 69A at Riverton, Kansas. \nThe Jayhawk Site can be characterized as flat with a typical base elevation on the order between 830-852 feet above mean sea level (MSL). Mean elevation of Jayhawk\u00bfs property is approximately 850 feet. The facility is located at latitude 37o06\u00bf59.4\u00bf North and longitude 094o:40\u00bf:27.6\u00bf West. The terrain in the local vicinity is flat to gently rolling land surface in a rural agricultural setting. The Spring River is located east and south of the facility. The land use immediately surrounding the facility is industrial with agricultural uses beyond the immediately adjoining land. Approximately 3.5 miles southeast of the facility is the town of Galena, KS., and approximately 22 miles to the north is the incorporated city of Pittsburg, KS.\nThe facility stores seven chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities listed in the US EPA Accidental Release Protection Regulations in the Clean Air Act Section 112\u00ae (RMP).

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately >20,000 persons located within the radius of the worst case scenario.\nAlternate Scenarios\nThe catastrophic failure of the containers, or simultaneous failure of all containers for a chemical, is highly unlikely. The tanks and cylinders have safety devices and systems to prevent or minimize the effect of any accidental release. An alternative scenario has been selected for each chemical that, although still very unlikely to occur, has a higher probability of occurrence than the worst case scenario, in accordance with U.S. EPA guidance.\nFor all alternative scenarios, the following assumptions were made:\nWind Speed:\t3 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour)\nStability Class:\tD\nAir Temperature:\t77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\nResidential population, public receptors and environmental receptors were assessed for each chemical within the radius of its associated endpoint. In most there was residential population, no environmental receptors, and the only public receptor that appears in the available data is the Boston Mills School located one-half mile east. This school was investigated and no longer exists. Therefore, there are no public receptors within the maximum endpoint radius of the alternative case scenarios.\nAcetaldehyde\nA more likely scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of the railcar unloading system.

For the alternative scenarios, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of \u00bfD\u00bf or \u00bfF\u00bf was used in accordance with the US EPA guidance.

The following is the RMPComp modeling results for the worst case scenario for methyl chloride:\nCategory: \tToxic Liquid\nLiquefied \tAtmos\nQuantity Released: \t67,000 pounds\nRelease Duration: \t361 min\nR"

      "SummaryText": "aphic data indicates that there are approximately 58 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\nAqua Ammonia 24%\nA more likely scenario for aqua ammonia is a failure during a tank trailer unloading. The chemical is transferred to the tank using air pressure, and should a hose fail, the entire contents of the tank trailer could escape. The alternative scenario for aqua ammonia is the failure of a 2-inch unloading line releasing all of the contents of a tank trailer. The volume of a single tank trailer is approximately 40,000 pounds. Therefore, the alternative scenario involves the release of 40,000 pounds of 24% aqua ammonia through a 2-inch hose. The following is the RMPComp modeling results for the alternative scenario:\nCategory: \tToxic Liquid\nQuantity Released: \t40000 pounds\nRelease Duration: \t10 min\nRelease Rate: \t960 pounds per minute\nLiquid Temperature: \t90 F\nMitigation Measures: \tNONE\nTopography: \tUrban surroundings (many obstacles in the immediate area)\nToxic Endpoint: \t0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: \t0.3 miles\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors within the 0.3-mile radius of the aqua ammonia tank (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 11 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\nChlorine\nA more likely scenario for chlorine is the failures of a single cylinder during handling. Therefore, the alternative scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine through a 2-inch rupture in a cylinder. The following is the RMPComp modeling results for the alternative scenario:\nCategory: \tToxic Gas\nRelease Duration: \t3.7 minutes\nStorage Parameters: \tHole or puncture area: 3.14 square inches\nTank Pressure: \t101.7 psi\nTank Temp: \t70 F\nRelease Rate: \t540 pounds per min\nMitigation Measures: \tRelease into enclosed space\nTopography: \tUrban surroundings (many obstacles in the immediate area)\nToxic E"

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 11 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\nEmergency Assistance\nEmergency assistance is provided by the Galena, KS Fire Department with mutual aid assistance agreements with Columbus, and Baxter Springs, KS Fire Departments. Columbus is located approximately 10 miles northwest of the facility, and Baxter Springs is located approximately 10 miles southwest of the facility. There is a Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for Cherokee County, KS. Mutual aid response times are approximately 30 minutes from the initiation of the notice. Jayhawk has trained its personnel in emergency response and emergency operations. Each supervisor is trained to provide the immediate response to an emergency with the personnel assigned to work in the area. There is a Jayhawk staffed fire brigade which has training in incipient stage fire respons. Additional support is provided through coordination of the emergency with outside agencies through use of the plant telephone and emergency notification system.\nAccident History\nJayhawk operates a modern facility with state of the art safety policies, practices and systems. There have been no off-site consequences involving regulated processes, or regulated chemicals, at the facility. There is no five-year accident history involving either regulated processes or chemicals that involve personnel injury, death or significant property damage.\nProcess Safety Information\nJayhawk maintains all of the safety information required by RMP. This includes Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), maximum intended inventories of regulated chemicals, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures and flows, and equipment specifications and manufacturing codes. The facility has been designed by industry-acc"
