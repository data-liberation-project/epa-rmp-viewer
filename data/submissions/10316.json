The Risk Management Program is based on the API Publication 761:  \"Model Risk Management Plan Guidance for Exploration and Production Facilities.\"\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Ulysses Booster Station are those included in the facility's Emergency Response Manual and PSM program. The Emergency Response Manual covers actions to be taken in case of an unplanned release. The mechanical integrity section of PSM covers actions taken to prevent an unplanned accidental release of regulated substances.\n\nThe Ulysses Booster Station is a natural gas compression, treating and dehydration facility. The process consists of compressing gas from the field, treating the gas through an amine unit to remove CO2, followed by glycol dehydration. The gas is compressed from approximately 6 psig to approximately 100 psig and delivered to Kansas Gas Services via pipeline where it is further compressed up to approximately 550 psig. Kansas Gas Services redelivers the 550 psig gas back to Pioneer Natural Resources (PNR). PNR then routes the gas through the amine contactors followed by the glycol contactor and then the gas is redelivered back to Kansas Gas Services where it is transported via pipeline to the Satanta Gas Plant which is located 10 miles to the east.\n\nPioneer Natural Resource's production office for this area is located adjacent to the booster station. The vehicles used by the production office and the plant personnel are duel fuel vehicles; operating on either propane or gasoline. The propane and gasoline storage tanks, both 30,000 gallon tanks are located approximately in the center of the facility making up the production office and the booster station.\n\nUlysses Booster Station was determined to be a program level 3 facility through the worst-case scenario analysis.  The worst-case scenario for this"

      "SummaryText": " facility would be a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) due to the instantaneous release of 130,000 pounds of propane.  The radius of exposure (ROE) resulting from the worst-case scenario release, assuming a full tank, is 0.40 miles.  An attended compressor station and unofficial wildlife refuge are within the radius of exposure.   Since the tank is used for fuel, someone will always be present when fuel is introduced or removed from the tank.  The alternative release scenario is also a VCE in which 30,000 pounds of residue gas, mostly methane, is released through a rupture in the inlet piping.  The distance to endpoint resulting from the alternative release scenario is 0.20 miles, assuming a release rate of 1000 pounds per minute for a duration of 30 minutes.  The same attended compressor station and unofficial wildlife refuge are within the radius of exposure for this case.  Pressure relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, and alarms are in place to help in the prevention of a release.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention measures taken are outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility. Some of the main components of this section that would help prevent the accidental uncontrolled release of regulated substances include:  testing of critical control and shutdown instruments, testing of PSV's and routine testing of piping and vessel corrosion.\n\nThere has not been a recordable / off-site accident in the previous five year history of this facility.\n\nThe emergency response program for this facility is contained in the Emergency Response Manual, ERM. The ERM include actions to take in case of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance, an uncontrollable fire and tornadoes. The proper action includes immediately contacting the Grant County Emergency Response system, which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public.\n\nThe facility has ongoing programs that "
