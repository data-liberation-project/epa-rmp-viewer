      "SummaryText": "Appomattox Bio Energy, LLC (ABE) will operate a 68.2 million gallon/year (MPY) fuel-grade, un-denatured ethanol facility in Hopewell, VA. There will be two processes covered under the provisions of 40 CFR 68:\nA?    Storage and use of aqueous ammonia\nA?    Storage and use of natural gasoline as a denaturant for ethanol\nABE will use aqueous ammonia solution with a maximum strength of 28 percent (%) by weight and stored onsite in a 10, 750 gallon (gal) above-ground storage tank which will be limited to a maximum fill of 90% of its capacity.  This exceeds the 20,000 pound (lb) threshold quantity for 20% or greater solutions of aqueous ammonia, so this process will be subject to the RMP program. There is no accident history since this is a new facility. Since modeling indicates that there could be offsite consequences from accidental releases of aqueous ammonia but since the process is not covered under OSHAA?s PSM standard, it will be subject to RMP Program 2 requirements.\nABE adds up to 5% of natural gasoline to denature 200 proof ethanol and make its final product unsuitable for human consumption.  Natural gasoline is stored in a 30,000 gallon above-ground storage tank. According to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2), if the concentration of a regulated flammable substance in a mixture is greater than 1% by weight, the entire mixture must be considered in the threshold determination, unless the mixture does not have a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 4. Due to the high variability of pentane and butane concentrations in natural gasoline, the variability of NFPA ratings for gasoline as well as ABEA?s desire to maintain flexibility in natural gasoline purchasing options, the storage of natural gasoline is included as a covered process. It is projected that the denatured ethanol would be unlikely to have a NFPA rating greater than 3 and would not be subject to RMP requirements. \nABE has developed a management system with the General Manager (GM) as the qualified person w"

      "SummaryText": "ith the overall responsibility for implementing and ensuring integration of the risk management program elements. When the responsibilities of implementing individual requirements are assigned to persons other than the GM, their names or positions and their lines of authority have also been defined.\nAlthough neither of the covered processes is subject to OHSAA?s PSM requirements, ABE has voluntarily elected to implement similar PSM elements as a best management practice to ensure safety. Therefore, ABEA?s prevention program will meet or exceed the RMP Program 2 requirements, and will at a minimum contain a hazard review, operating procedures, a training program, maintenance procedures, incident investigation process, and a compliance audit program.\nABEA?s plan is to only provide internal response personnel for incipient fires and low level aqueous ammonia emergencies. Therefore, ABE will incorporate the use of local emergency response organizations into its emergency response plan for more serious emergency events related to the covered processes. The ERP will delineate the decision tree to be used to determine whether to employ onsite or offsite emergency response personnel. While ABEA?s level of emergency response would only require an emergency action plan, ABE has voluntarily elected to develop an ERP that will meet or exceed the requirements of the emergency action plan called for under OSHAA?s 29 CFR 1910.38a. \n"
