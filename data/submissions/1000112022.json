Nova also performs \u0093product distillation\u0094 where product materials are accepted, and distillation is performed to produce ultra-high purity chemical products.   Finally, other chemical manufacturing from raw materials is also performed at the site. \n\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety of its employees and neighboring community. Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's emergency response plan. Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measures (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of recovered materials in the event of a release. Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and spills.  However, the Sumter Fire Department is the primary responder in the event of a release beyond the incipient stage.\n\n(b) The facility consists of several chemical manufacturing/distillation processes, including the manufacture of synthetic acetonitrile.  As part of that process, Nova utilizes anhydrous ammonia, which will be stored in three, 9,200 gallon above-ground pressure tanks (one tank is installed at the time of this initial registration and two are pending installation) and is also present throughout several vessels, piping, and other ancillary equipment in the synthetic acetonitrile process.\n\n(c) The facility"

As such, Nova has implemented a Level 3 Prevention Program required at 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D.  The objective of the accident prevention program is to develop a proactive approach to the identification, evaluation, and prevention of chemical releases. Nova strives to meet these objectives through the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs. The key elements of these programs are: \n\n1. Employee participation\n2. Process safety information\n3. Process hazard analysis\n4. Operating procedures\n5. Training\n6. Contractor safety\n7. Pre-startup safety reviews\n8. Mechanical integrity program\n9. Hot work permitting\n10. Management of change\n11. Incident investigations\n12. Emergency response plans\n13. Compliance audits\n\n(d) The facility has not experienced an accident with off-site impacts meeting the criteria at 40 CFR Part 68.10(g)(1) during the past five years.\n\n(e) Nova has developed and implemented an emergency response plan under the Program Level 3 RMP requirements. The Emergency Response Plan provides detailed response, notification, reporting, and evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency situation at the facility and consists of the main elements of the RMP Emergency Response Plan requirements.  Emergency response training includes: notification of appropriate personnel (company and off-site responders); hazardous material identification; release assessment; control procedures; prevention of recurrence or spread of fires/releases; and incident clean-up. The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event of a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment).  The Sumter County Emergency Management Office, Sumter Fire Department, City of Sumter Police Department, Sumter County Sheriff's Department, and Prisma Health Tuomey Hospital are part of the em"

However, the facility is not considered a \u0093responding facility\u0094 under the RMP regulations.  The facility has coordinated its response activities with the local response agencies and these agencies, along with private contractors may be notified in the event of larger fires and/or releases.\n\n(f) The facility provides refresher employee training regularly that incorporates safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response. The facility also performs monthly safety meetings on various topics taken from suggestions provided by facility employees to improve general site safety and RMP-constituent safety procedures. Nova does not currently manage any other RMP-regulated chemicals at the Race Track Road facility.  However, in the event that other RMP chemicals are managed at the site, Nova will actively manage the processing of these chemicals such that the quantities of the chemicals are below the RMP threshold quantities.  In the event that any additional RMP chemicals are processed at the facility above the RMP threshold quantities, this RMP will be updated accordingly."
