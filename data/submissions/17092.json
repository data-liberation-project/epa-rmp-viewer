This ensures that Plant Operators are fully capable of effectively operating the plant. The plant has successfully operated several years without a lost time accident over the past decade. \n\n\tThe plant is designed to provide reliable operations year-round.  Power to the plant originates from two different electrical sources, providing electrical redundancy, thereby reducing the potential occurrence of a total power outage.    The plant is designed with redundant equipment at every phase of the treatment process.  Thus, when an equipment failure occurs, the process can continue producing a high quality final effluent and providing maximum protection to our environment.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Commission accidental release prevention program is part of the agency\u0012s overall Safety & Health Program and involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to ensure our workers and the public a safe environment.  The RMP requirement is essentially an expansion of the OSHA Process Safety requirement and the Employee and Community Right to Know programs that have been in existence for a number of years.   \n\n\tHazardous material has always been recognized as a unique hazard for our employees and the public; therefore, we have made every possible effort to ensure the proper and safe use of all hazardous materials.
