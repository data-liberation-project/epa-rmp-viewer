Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe City of Litchfield, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant uses the chemical chlorine for the purpose of disinfection of the city wastewater effluent. Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The City of Litchfield is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine storage and feed processes at our facility. It is our policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends on the safe handling procedures that we use combined with the safety devices included in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\n\nIf a release of chlorine should occur, we are coordinated with the Litchfield Emergency dispatcher and in turn the Litchfield Fire Department and Emergency Operations Coordinator, who will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of an unforeseen release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Litchfield, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant has one regulated substance, chlorine, at the facility. Chlorine, a toxic gas stored under pressure as a liquid, is used for disinfection of the city's wastewater effluent. The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility at any time is two - 2,000 pound tanks, for a total of 4,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenario, we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants and RMP*Comp, ver. 1.06. For alternative release scenario analysis, the release rate was estimated by The Chlorine"

      "SummaryText": " Institute, Inc. using the SAFER/TRACER model, Pamphlet, 74, Edition 3, April 1998. The distance to endpoint is based on EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants, Exhibit 4-12.\n\nWorst-Case Senario - Failure of the largest chlorine storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents are release as vapor in an outdoor setting within 10 minutes of tank failure. A rural setting was chosen as the topographical setting. Under worst-case conditions, the maximum distance of 3.0 miles corresponding to an endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (v/v) is reached. The endpoint basis is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2), developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - An outdoor release of gas due to valve failure was considered for the alternative release scenario. It is assumed that mitigation occurs within one hour of the start of the release under neutral weather conditions. As in the worst-case scenario, a rural topographical setting was chosen.\n\nThe maximum distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (v/v) is 0.2 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary and could potentially follow the creek bed located north of the chlorine treatment building.\n\n4. The general Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Litchfield, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in 40CFR part 68. The Plant is also in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine cylinders are handled minimally outside of the facility and are stored indoors. Additionally, a vacuum demand chlorine delivery system automatically stops the flow of chlorine if a piping or valve f"

Wastewater treatment plant operators are competent in the chlorine system operations and are trained in the hazards and operating procedures associated with the chlorine processes.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nThe Litchfield, MN Wastwater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the history of the facility. There have been no documented releases over the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response\nEmergency Response by the Litchfield, MN Wastewater Treatment Plant employees will be limited to incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Litchfield Fire Department and the emergency dispatcher. The Wastewater Treatment Plant's Emergency Response Plan is studied, practiced, and updated as needed.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs a result of the Process Hazard Assessment conducted at the facility and development of the PSM and RMP programs, a number of steps have been taken to improve safety at the plant."
