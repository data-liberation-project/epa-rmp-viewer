The Facility Policy\n\n\tThe management and employees of AgMax, Inc., Goodland Agronomy are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n\t-The primary activity at this facility is the storage and bending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\t-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production.\n\n\t- The maximum quantity stored would be 267,800 pounds in our two (2) - 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity would be the unloading of a truck holding 45,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released over 10 (ten) minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 133,900 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at eighty five (85) percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point if dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is  0.22 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\t The facility has implemented the provisions of  Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational  Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.

The Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\t- The facility has:\n\n\ta.  a written emergency response action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\tb.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\tc.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 239 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
