It is Ovintiv, Inc.'s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility consists of a single 18,00-gallon tank, which is filled to a maximum of 80% capacity. The tank contains a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, isobutane, and isopentane. The facility consists of separation and dehydration equipment, condensate storage areas, and compressor buildings used for treatment and compression of gas for sale.  As part of the Pleasant Valley compressor station operation, the facility handles -two EPA/RMP-covered flammable substances in quantities greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The Pleasant Valley compressor station does not have any EPA/RMP-regulated toxic chemicals. A single public receptor was found to fall within the distance to the endpoint around the Pleasant Valley Compressor Station.  The facility is regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 - Program Level 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  In the event of a leak or overflow, all valves associated with that portion of the system will be closed and the system shut down to prevent additional releases while response procedures are initiated.  When a spill occurs outside of the containment, or in the event of a large or catastrophic release, personnel must take the necessary precautions t"

Such notification also allows the company to promptly report a spill event to appropriate government agencies, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThe Pleasant Valley Compressor Station has not had an accident in the last five years that caused onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe facility will continue to coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Duchesne County Fire & Emergency Management Office. Ovintiv, Inc. employees are trained with the expectation that they will evacuate and restrict access to the facility until both the safety and exposure potentials are no longer a threat. All employees are trained to discover releases and take no further action beyond making notification. As appropriate other LEPC and other coordinating agencies and local hospitals may be involved. \n\n\n\nThe Gas Services Coordinator is responsible for coordinating emergency actions, and essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nNo changes to improve safety are planned at this time.\n\n\n\n"
