This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant, located near Glenrock, Wyoming, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate from the produced well stream.  In addition, the plant operates a NGL extraction process to prouduce an NGL product.  The Sage Creek Gas Plant has regulated flammables from butane through Pentane.  These compounds may be present in both hydrocarbon mixtures and as essentially pure compounds.  \n\n\n\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as Program 1 under the Risk Management Plan and handled accordingly.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Sage Creek Gas Plant.  The Sage Creek Gas Plant was recently reclassified from RMP Program 3 to RMP Program 1 because no public receptors could be indentified within any calculated radius of exposure.  Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPAs Risk Management Program and are also subject to OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accidental prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety informat"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant's PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of the PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material data safety sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in Key Process Parameter documents.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analyses as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHA's are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company's local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team finding are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate signi"

The results and finding from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Sage Creek Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as:\n\n\n\n1.    Unit startup\n\n2.    Normal operations\n\n3.    Temporary operations\n\n4.    Emergency shutdown\n\n5.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Sage Creek Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper or lower limits.  This information along with operating procedures is readily available to the operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operation, the Sage Creek Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. though tests, skills demo"
