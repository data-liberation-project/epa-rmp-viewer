The facility is subject to the requirements of this program due to the production and storage of natural gas liquid (NGL) containing over 10,000 lbs. of regulated flammable substances.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is located in a remote section of St. Landry Parish approximately three miles southwesterly of Krotz Springs, LA.  Public access to the facility is restricted and surrounding property is privately owned.\n\n\n\nThe facility receives high & low-pressure wet field gas from various well sites in the vicinity.  High-pressure field gas is routed to a bulk high-pressure separator and low-pressure gas is compressed and commingled with the high-pressure stream. The gas stream is injected with ethylene glycol to prevent hydrates and is routed to a heat exchanger for cooling.  The cool gas enters a propane refrigeration unit and then a three-phase cold separator.  Gas from the cold separator is used as a cooling medium and then sold by pipeline.  Ethylene glycol from the cold separator is recycled.  Natural gas liquids (NGL) from the cold separator are routed to one of two 48,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels and eventually sold by pipeline. According to the facility operator, once a storage vessel reaches approximately 60% capacity the flow of the incoming NGL product is switched to the second vessel.  The product in the 60% full vessel is then pumped to a pipeline for sales.\n\n\n\nThe threshold quantity for all flammable substances under 40 CFR part 68 is 10,000 lbs. The NGL contains a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, pentane and other heavier hydrocarbons.  Since the concentration of regulated substances in the mixture is greater than 1 percent by weight the entire quantity of NGL was included in determining the quantity present on site.  For purposes of RMP-Submit, the worst-case release scenario an"

      "SummaryText": "d the alternative-case release scenario the regulated substance is noted as being butane since it is the predominant flammable component in the mixture with the highest heat of combustion.  \n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario involves a tank failure due to a 1-psi overpressure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The scenario assumes failure of all safety devices and a release of the product within one of the 48,000-gallon storage vessels filled to 60% capacity (134,111 lbs of NGL).  The distance to the endpoint for an explosion of 134,111 lbs. of NGL is 0.4 mile.  According to USGS maps and operator knowledge of the area there are no public or environmental receptors within a 0.4-mile radius of the facility.  The closest receptor is a private residence/camp located 0.9 mile from the facility.  The residential population within the worst-case circle is estimated to be zero.\n\n\n\nThe 48,000 BBL NGL storage vessels are equipped with pop-off relief valves that vent to the atmosphere and automatically operate according to preset pressure specifications.  Safety valves are located at the inlet of each vessel with an additional safety valve controlling the inlet to both vessels.  These valves would automatically stop the flow in and/or out of the vessels if a leak were detected by way of a significant pressure drop across the valve.  A manual shut off valve is located at the plant outlet stream and would be closed by an operator in the event of an emergency situation.  An alternative release scenario involves the activation of the safety valves at the vessel inlet due to either a faulty relief valve, or pipe fracture.  Using RMP*Comp Version 1.06 to calculate a release of this type produces a release rate of 2,360 lbs./min.  The distance to the endpoint for a release of this amount of NGL is 0.1 mile. According to USGS maps and operator knowledge of the area there are no public or environmental receptors within a 0.1-mile radius of the facility.  The residential population "
