      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Rothermel Conditioning Plant  \r\n\r\nDevon Gas Services, L.P., owner and operator of the Rothermel Conditioning Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Devon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nInlet Separation and Cooling\r\n\r\nGas enters the plant at 925 psig and enters an inlet separator.  No free liquids are expected here as the gas is dry (less than 7 lb/MMCF water content) and above its hydrocarbon dew point.  Any unexpected liquids caught may be dumped directly to the stabilizer and mixed with plant product or dumped to atmospheric storage.  After separation the gas is cooled in a gas to gas exchanger and then chilled to -28 F in a chiller (heat exchanger) which utilizes a mixed refrigerant (Composition: approximately 60% R-143a, 35% R-125, and 5% R-134a).  The gas leaving the chiller contains condensed hydrocarbons; these are separated in the cold separator and fed to a product stabilizer with the gas from the cold separator (residue gas) returned to the gas to gas exchanger to cool the inlet gas.  \r\n\r\nProduct Stabilization and Storage\r\n\r\nThe product stabilizer utilizes an electric heater to boil the light hydrocarbons (methane and lighter) out of the product.  These are recycled to the inlet of the rich gas side of the gas to gas exchanger through a compressor.  The product from the bottom of the stabilizer is cooled in a heat exchanger to about 120 F and stored in pressurized product tanks.  The stabilizer will be operated so that the true vapor pressure of the product is"

      "SummaryText": "200 psig or less. Product is loaded out at atmospheric temperature on trucks that utilize pressurized, un-insulated tanks.\r\n\r\nRefrigeration\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system consists of the chiller mentioned above, and a set of electric motor driven compressors, refrigerant condensers and a refrigerant surge tank.  The refrigerant leaves the refrigerant surge tank as a liquid at a pressure of about 300 psig and is dumped through a valve to the cold side of the chiller where it vaporizes at low pressure (5 psig) to provide cooling of the gas.  The refrigerant vapor from the chiller is compressed through a set of electric motor driven compressors which compress the refrigerant vapor back up to 300 psig where it is cooled through a set of air cooled exchangers to about 20 degrees above atmospheric temperature.  As it cools, it condenses to the liquid phase and is then returned to the refrigerant surge tank.\r\n\r\nResidue gas\r\n\r\nThe residue gas which leaves the gas to gas exchanger is routed to a final separator (outlet separator) at pressure that is about 20 psi below the inlet pressure and about 15 degrees below the inlet gas temperature.  No liquid is expected to be captured at the final separator-its purpose is to prevent an accidental carryover of liquids into the outlet gas piping.  From the outlet gas separator the residue gas is meter and returned to the gas pipeline.\r\n\r\nMethanol injection\r\n\r\nA small amount of methanol is injected into the inlet gas (about 5 BBLD, 20 BBLD max) to prevent freezing within the plant.  Some of this methanol is absorbed in the product along with traces of water condensed from the gas.  The remaining water condensed from the gas and the remaining unabsorbed methanol form a second liquid phase in the cold separator.  This second liquid phase is dumped from the cold separator directly to the atmospheric storage tank and is trucked off of the site.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nThe Rothermel Conditioning Plan"
