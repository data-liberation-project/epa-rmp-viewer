Cogeneration Facility 38 has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System. Cogeneration Facility 38's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance.\nThe Cogeneration Facility 38 is located at 28601 Hovey Hill Road, Taft, California. The regulated substance at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 9,600 gallons (54,720 pounds [lbs.]) and it is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage tank (T-1001) at ambient temperature in liquid form.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor.  The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air.  The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).  This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment.  The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack.\n \nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary: Per CalARP Regulations and US EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Injection System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the most recent program documentation. \n\nAlternative Rele"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the most recent program documentation.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Cogeneration Facility 38 has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  \n\nTurbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model). In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following.\n- Automatic / Manual Shutdown\n- Well Designed Relief System\n- Safety showers/eye wash stations are available for Operators, if exposed to ammonia at the ammonia fill station.\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n- The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nKey Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Cogeneration Facility 38 to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe pract"

The amount of anhydrous ammonia corresponds to the 80% capacity of T-1001, as the facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum filling of the tanks to 80% of the capacity. Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000-lb threshold quantity for US EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities, and over the 500-lb state threshold for CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, US EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM. The program documentation includes required elements from these regulations.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nFor any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of 19 CCR \u00a72750.9, the owner or operator shall submit the data required under 19 CCR \u00a72745.5, \u00a72745.6, and \u00a72745.7 with respect to that accident within six months of the release or by the time the RMP is updated under 19 CCR \u00a72745.10, whichever is earlier. From 19 CCR \u00a72750.9: \"The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"\n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of ammonia at Cogeneration Facility 38 in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nCogeneration Facility 38 has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and none of it's personnel are first responders.  The facility has implemented an EAP that meets the requirements of 8 CCR \u00a73220 and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency.  Employees are trained to evacuate and call 9-1-1.  The Cogeneration Facility 38 will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders.  They are train"
