      "SummaryText": "Owensboro Grain Edible Oils operates a vegetable oil refining facility at 1145 Ewing Road, Owensboro, Kentucky. The plant began operations in 1995 in a newly constructed facility. Unrefined vegetable oils are delivered to the facility via underground pipeline. Processing operations include refining, deodorizing, color treatment and hydrogenation capabilities.The facility consists of a refinery building, biodiesel building, glycerin refining building, tankfarm and includes railcar wash, truck wash and wastewater treatment structures. The facility produces refined vegetable oils,biodiesel, and refined glycerin and will hydrogen to further process a portion of soybean oil and soy methyl ester (biodiesel). The finished products are loaded and shipped off site via truck, rail and barge. New hydrogenation equipment is to be installed in 2017 and 2018. The facility stopped using the original hydrogenation process around 2005, and will be operating a similar system in 2018. The hydrogen will be stored in two pressure vessels, designed, inspected and tested in accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 1. Each vessel has a net capacity of liquid hydrogen of 18,000 gallons, and a maximum allowable working pressure of 150 PSIG. The hydrogen operation is covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and this rule. The system is equipped with extensive safety devices. The accidental release program for hydrogen includes the Process Hazard Analysis conducted in 2017 for the Process Safety Management standard. The major hazards identified in the analysis are the possibility of fire, explosion, over-pressurization, equipment failure and natural disaster. The facility has an emergency response plan in place and is covered by the community plan coordinated through the Daviess County Emergency Planning Committee. The process controls in place for the system include emergency vents, relief valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, rupture disks"

      "SummaryText": ", equipment grounding, and alarms and procedures. Other mitigation systems or monitoring/detection systems were not considered appropriate for the operations. The hydrogen tank system is designed to vent to atmosphere and does experience venting occasionally, posing no hazard to public receptors.Since initiation of operations, there have been no releases which resulted in off-site consequences.The remote possibility of a worst case release could result in a release of the entire contents of one vessel and a resultant vapor cloud explosion. Utilizing the EPA Offsite Consequences Analysis (OCA) Guidance, the affected distance to an endpoint is 0.20 miles in the case of a worst case release."
