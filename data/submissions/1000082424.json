The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nAspen has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Aspen Battle Horse Plant is located near Brenham, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products: \n\n\n\n1. Stabilized Condensate\n\n2. NGL\n\n3. Residue Gas\n\n\n\nThese substances can contain the following components:\n\n\n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng. Isopentane\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nA. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nAspen encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n\n4.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety- related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nAspen maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\n\n\n\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\n\n\nE. Training\n\n\n\nAspen has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nN. Specialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nSite specific detection and control equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the plant to:\n\n\n\n1. Contain/control a release\n\n2. Quickly detect a release, and\n\n3. Reduce the consequences of an RMP-regulated substance release\n\n\n\nThe following type of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n2. Perimeter monitors to detect a loss of containment from process piping and equipment\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n3. Automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and automatically operate all automatic valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare.\n\n4.
