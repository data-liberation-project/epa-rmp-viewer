FHR Marysville is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  The FHR Marysville site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements these policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  FHR Marysville participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  The FHR Marysville site has remained both a safe and quality supplier for over 20 years in Southeastern Michigan as exemplified by our continuing certification to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001 quality management process.\r\n\r\nFHR Marysville is located in the southwestern corner of the City of Marysville, Michigan.  The site includes 58.6 acres, of which 20 acres have been developed.  The Marysville Site utilizes a continuous polymerization operation to convert pipeline-supplied propylene and ethylene into polypropylene pellets which molding companies then process into useful applications such as:  automotive trim, toys, medical containers, appliance parts, and other consumer products.  Propane is produced as a by-product of propylene purification.\r\n\r\n2.\tRegulated Substances.\r\nFHR Marysville has 2 regulated substances above threshold quantities at the facility.  The two flammable substances are:\r\n\r\n\tPropylene - Used to produce synthetic polymer resins.\r\n\tPropane - Used widely for home heating.\r\n\r\n3.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis.\r\nThe RMP Rule requires an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed"

FHR Marysville has established a system intended to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are reviewed with affected personnel.\r\n \r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFHR Marysville has developed a written plan for employee participation in its PSM and RMP programs.  FHR Marysville consults with employees on the conduct and development of PHA's and on the development of other elements of the PSM and RMP programs.  FHR Marysville provides employees access to PHA's and other PSM/RMP information.\r\n \r\nHot Work Permit\r\nFHR Marysville employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations).  If hot work is performed near the covered process, FHR Marysville issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot work permits are kept on file until the work is complete.  \r\n \r\nContractors\r\n FHR Marysville has developed procedures for selecting and maintaining competent and knowledgeable contractors.  These procedures are intended to ensure that contractors can safely perform their work.  FHR Marysville provides information to contractors about the hazards that may be present in the work area and has developed appropriate safe work practices.  FHR Marysville also evaluates the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\r\n \r\n5.\t5 Year Accident History\r\n FHR Marysville has no accidental releases to report for the 5-Year Accident History that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage or known"
