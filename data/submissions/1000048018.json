      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nThe Cedar Crest Ice Cream facility refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Cedar Crest Ice Cream to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) and an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nCedar Crest Ice Cream Plant is an ice cream production, distribution facility, and seasonal ice cream parlor. The refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has a maximum intended inventory of 11,271 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\n3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCedar Crest Ice Cream complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with"

      "SummaryText": " published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations. \n\n\n\nCedar Crest Ice Cream's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration systems include employee participation, Process Safety Information (PSI), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), training, contractor safety, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR), mechanical integrity, Management of Change (MOC), hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA). Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia. Startup, shutdown, and any system adjustments are handled by these qualified persons. \n\n\n\n4.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe facility has been below the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) until this submittal.  The facility has not had a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia within the last five years.  \n\n\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nCedar Crest Ice Cream has a written Emergency Action Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a co"

      "SummaryText": "urse of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at the Cedar Crest Ice Cream facility and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency. The refrigeration processes have back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\n\nEmergency Alarm and Communication System\n\nEvacuation Routes, and Assembly Points\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance are established with the Manitowoc Fire Department, including the Manitowoc County HazMat Team. The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n\n\nAll Cedar Crest Ice Cream personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. \n\n\n\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nUpgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time and will also be evaluated through the Management of Change (MOC) element as required by PSM standards. In addition, all of the recommendations from the initial PHA will be addressed in a timely manner which will improve the safety and practice of the Cedar Crest Ice Cream facility.\n\n"
