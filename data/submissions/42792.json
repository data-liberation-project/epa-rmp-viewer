Due to the quantity of toxic and flammable chemicals stored at the facility, PRC is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program.  The purpose of the Risk Management Program is to prevent or reduce the severity of an accidental release of a hazardous chemical.  Among the requirements of the Risk Management Program is the submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizing the overall program.  The following information is an Executive Summary of the information contained in the Risk Management Program.  This Executive Summary includes a description of PRC's accidental release prevention and safety policies, a facility and process description, an explanation of the accidental release scenarios studied, a five-year accident history, and details of PRC's accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n2.0     Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nPolymer Research Corporation takes great care to ensure the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  PRC policies and safety programs are stressed in all aspects of the facility operations.  The safety program provides rules and guidance for safe working methods in the operation, maintenance and construction of the facility.  It includes the required personnel protective equipment, safe work practices including lockout and tagout, hot work permitting, confined space entry, forklift operation, and safe handling of flammable and toxic chemicals.  Employees are trained in the safe operation of the facility.\n\n\n\n3.0     Facility and Process Description\n\nThe Polymer Research Corporation facility in Centreville, MS, manufactures polymers for use in the water treatment industry.\n\n\n\n4.0     Regulated Substances Present\n\nFormaldehyde, epichlorohydrin, dimethylamine and hydrochloric acid are the substances used at PRC?s Centreville facility"

The regulations define the worst case release as the loss of the entire maximum inventory of the largest tank or vessel.  The regulations require that the offsite impact of the worst case release scenario be calculated using very conservative, worst case weather conditions.  USEPA has published Risk Management Planning software to determine the offsite distance an accidental release would travel.  Polymer Research Corporation used the latest version available, RMP*Comp Version 1.07, to calculate worst case release scenario offsite impact distances.\n\n\n\nPolymer Research Corporation also used that software to calculate the offsite impact distances for alternate, more realistic accidental release scenarios for both toxic and flammable substances.  These alternate release scenarios took into consideration safety systems and controls in place to reduce the severity of an accidental release and to consider a more realistic release rate.  The alternate releases considered resulted from a hose rupture caused by a pull-away during tank filling.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe PRC facility?s accident prevention program includes each of the elements required by the Risk Program Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\n6.1    Process Safety Information\n\nPolymer Research Corporation has gathered the necessary documentation of safety information on the covered processes including the maximum/minimum pressure, operating temperature, inventories in covered tanks, tank and piping materials of construction, documentation of design codes and standards used for the tanks and piping, and description of safety systems in place.  This information is periodically reviewed to ensure that the process"

The results of the review were used to determine the appropriate safeguards needed to prevent failures or errors that could lead to an accidental release.\n\n\n\n6.3    Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for plant operations.  The purpose of the written operating procedures is to make sure that prior to operating a process each employee is knowledgeable of the correct operating methods, is aware of the chemical hazards present,  and is qualified to respond correctly in an emergency situation.\n\n\n\n6.4    Training\n\nNew employees are trained in the safe operation of plant processes and their performance is periodically evaluated.  As needed, refresher training is provided.  Employees are given safety training and are trained in the emergency response procedures discussed in Section 8.0.\n\n\n\n6.5    Maintenance\n\nWritten maintenance procedures and training guide the safe work practices of maintenance employees and ensure that they are made aware of the potential hazards of the plant processes.  A hot work permitting program, lockout-tagout procedures and confined space entry procedures have been put in place to protect maintenance workers while servicing equipment.  Preventive maintenance inspections and testing are scheduled based on manufacturer recommendations so that aging equipment can be replaced before failing and possibly causing an accidental release.\n\n\n\n7.0    Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo serious accidents have occurred at PRC?s Centreville facility in the last five years.\n\n\n\n8.0    Emergency Response Coordination\n\nThis facility has satisfied the requirement that, if the employees cannot respond to the release of regulated substances, P"
