The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management and employees of AGP Grain Cooperative at Muriel, Nebraska, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,\nthe facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitiagate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information\n\n      The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and loading out of grain, with tha sale of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer to farmers as a secondary and seasonal business.\n\n      Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farmers.\n\n      The maximum quanity stored would be 69,360pounds in the main storage tank and four nurse tanks.  The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of a 12,000 gallon storage tank holding 52,020 pounds.\n\n3.    The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximuim quantity released would be 52,020 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent  capacity as li;mited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n       b.  The alternative release scenario (the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint( point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4.    The accidental release prevention program.\n\n        The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standard Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n         There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.      The emergencey response program.\n\n          The facility has:\n\n          a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n          b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know informat-\n              ion as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.       Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic; evaluations are performed to\n          access the maintenance  of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia \n          safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
