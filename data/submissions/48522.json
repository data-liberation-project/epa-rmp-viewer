Mechanisms include, but are not limited to: Compliance Audits, PHA revalidations/updates, Inspections and Maintenance.  The PHA revalidation study team recently developed new recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release.  Key recommendations identified during the study included:\n\n\u00bf\tAdded security fencing is under consideration\n\u00bf\tImprove tag-out system for seasonal shutdown\n\u00bf\tImprovements to specified training materials\n\u00bf\tProvide additional training on SOP\u00bfs\n\nACS has developed a schedule to document the implementation of the recommendations.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe EPA RMP regulation requires that an Executive Summary be provided as part of the registration submitted to the EPA.  This submittal is part of the required 5-year update of the RMP.  This Executive Summary has been revised in accordance with regulatory changes in 2004, including the removal of Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) results.  The OCA was however updated in the update process; LandView\u00bf V was used to execute the update.  No other changes were applicable.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is ACS\u00bf policy to comply with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  ACS has developed their RMP / PSM Manual to document policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study, procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.\n\nACS has adopted an overall \u00bfNon-responding facility\u00bf policy; employees are to notify and evacuate in the event of an emergency situation.  ACS has performed coordination activities with the local Fire Department. ACS is also supported by Western Precooling Systems (WPS) which has 1910.120(q) trained technicians.  These technicians are on-call to the facility and are intended to support the Fire Dept. during an emergency situation. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe ACS facility is located in an industrial area of Yuma and provides product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (System). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, built in 2001 to the latest codes and standards in use at that time.

ACS has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings which the audit may find.  (Addressed under Compliance Audits).\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe ACS facility has had no reportable accidental ammonia release in the last five years.  There is no data to report.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nACS\u00bfs Emergency Response Program is described within the RMP /PSM Manual.  An Emergency Action Plan has been established for the facility.  This plan includes planned activities and procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.  The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training.  The facility emergency plan is reviewed and appropriate updates submitted annually to the AZ State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Yuma County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the City of Yuma Fire Department.  The City Fire Department has been involved with the facility since its opening (via the permitting process) and makes periodic visits.  Coordination with these Agencies is accomplished in this way.  ACS is also a co-sponsor of the Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day.  This is an annual event that promotes safety, training and a strong working relationship between Regulatory Agencies, the local Ammonia Refrigeration Industry and the Public.     \n\nUnder ACS\u00bfs Emergency Response policy, ACS employees who have been trained as \u00bfFirst Responder-Awareness\u00bf may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  ACS will evacuate the affected area, begin notification process,"

Cold Room evaporators are located inside; however, their associated valves and piping are located on the roof.\n\nA portion of the ammonia equipment is portable and is moved on and off site annually as needed for the local produce season.  The interconnecting piping between the portable components is permanently mounted.  Additionally some vessels and the Cold Room evaporators are permanently mounted.\n\nAccess to the facility is limited by a combination of fencing, gates, and retention basins on the perimeter.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nACS\u00bfs Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is very similar to OSHA\u00bfs PSM Program.  The Prevention Program implemented by ACS is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\n\nKey Objectives of ACS\u00bfs Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1.\tMaintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter).\n2.\tProvide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system (Process Hazard Analysis-PHA).  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g. earthquakes).  Safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by ACS (addressed under PHA chapter).  The PHA was updated and revalidated in October 2006, by a team representing management, engineering, operations and maintenance.\n3.\tWritten procedures (SOP\u00bfs) and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained, and how to investigate accidental releases or a \u00bfnear miss\u00bf (addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters).\n4.\tCertification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.

This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Program (e.g. PHA study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators\u00bf day-to-day activities.  Second, all ACS employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility are to receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities are to improve the overall safety of the employees (both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter).\n6.\tImplementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a PHA, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by ACS\u00bfs Management of Change Procedure.  If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, ACS has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company\u00bfs experience and safety history.  Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \u00bfHot Work\u00bf occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, an ACS Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.  Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.
