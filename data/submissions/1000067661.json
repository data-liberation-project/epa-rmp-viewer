Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nThe Rosemount Terminal is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of each covered process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards involved in the processes.  Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\nThe Rosemount Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise and PHA facilitator training.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.\n\nAs a minimum the Rosemount Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\n\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The Rosemount Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved and documented by management.\n\nOperating Procedures (OP):\n\nThe Rosemount Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance "
