Introduction\r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan of Cottage Grove - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M Company, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M Company was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M Company has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions and releases to water. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cottage Grove Fire Department arrives. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \r\n \r\n\r\n3.  The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nWe manufacture specialty chemicals for internal and external customers for use in making a wide variety of products from sandpaper to medical imaging materials.  We use a regulated substance at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance. \r\n\r\nThe following regulated substance is used at Cottage Grove - 3M Company:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid, a non-flammable, corrosive acid, is a key raw material used to make such products as replacements"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 Training - At Cottage Grove - 3M Company, we have a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees who are operating hazardous processes understand and are well trained in the correct operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 Mechanical Integrity - We conduct and document maintenance checks on hazardous process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and instrumentation, and pumps.  Maintenance activities are conducted by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices or other specialized subjects as needed.  Equipment deficiencies are identified so that they can be corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Management of Change - We have established written procedures at Cottage Grove - 3M Company to manage changes in process materials, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other appropriate employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are notified and provided any needed training. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 Pre-Startup Reviews - These safety reviews for new processes and modifications to established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cottage Grove - 3M Company.
