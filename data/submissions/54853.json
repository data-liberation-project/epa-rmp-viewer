      "SummaryText": "The Arkema Inc. (Arkema) Axis, Alabama plant (Axis plant) has implemented the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP or Plan) program to documents steps taken to reduce accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community..  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including the following:\n-Introduction,\n-Arkema Inc. policies to protect health, environment, and safety,\n-Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes,\n-Prevention program,\n-Five-year accident history, and \nEmergency response plan.\n\nArkema's Policies on Health, Environment and Safety\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns to Arkema for many years.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  Arkema is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner while reducing risks to human health and the environment.  This commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  Employees and contractors carry through this emphasis on safety to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement to safety.  \nHES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Arkema's commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include RMP guidance that helps our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidental releases.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\nAxis plant is located on Highway 43, approximately 7 miles north of Exit 19 on Interstate 65.  The facility manufactures chemicals, which are primarily used as addi"

Two of these substances, chlorine and 1,3-butadiene, are present at or above the minimum RMP threshold quantity.  These chemicals are the building blocks (raw material) for some of the plant's major products.  Arkema knows that these and other chemicals that we handle are hazardous and/or flammable.  We handle these chemicals with a great deal of care and respect.  \n\nThis facility is subject to Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The facility also handles chemicals that are subject to OSHA 1910.119, Process Safety Management.  In 2001, the facility applied for inclusion in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and met the requirements to be recognized as a STAR site.\n\nPrevention Program\nReleases are prevented by designing for safety, maintaining for safe operation, monitoring for safe operations, operating safely, and by auditing for safety. The facility designs for safety by \n-conducting hazard studies to identify potential release scenarios and assess safeguards, \n-completing hazard studies for design changes, \n-maximizing employee participation in design work, \n-designing components with multiple automatic safety shutdowns, \n-incorporating emergency shutoff valves into the process and transfer systems, \n-maintaining computer systems to facilitate process and emergency shutdowns, \n-designing process operations to stop process reactions quickly, \n-installing fire fighting equipment at strategic locations throughout the plant, and \n-maintaining appropriate emergency escape routes from the units.  \n\nWe maintain safe operations by operating a preventive maintenance program for tanks, equipment, and piping, conducting routine mechanical inspections to determine that metal thickness is adequate over the life of the equipment, routinely testing emergency shutdown devices and safety systems, checking sensors as part of a preventive maintenance program, and us"

The facility operates more than 80 chemical gas sensors, which detect leaks at low levels.  Sensors sound alarms to warn workers and many are designed to automatically shutdown the process area in a safe state.  The process has emergency shutoff valves that can be controlled from several locations.  The facility employs trained, knowledgeable, process safety certified operators.  The operators are trained through the use of detailed operating procedures.   Many operations are computer controlled and monitored.  Additionally, video cameras are used to watch key areas and high pressure, temperature, and level alarms are used wherever required.  The facility audits its safety programs frequently.  In-plant and corporate personnel conduct process safety audits, plant personnel conduct operations and safety inspections regularly.  The site investigates incidents and near misses, finding root cause and developing corrective actions to prevent recurrence. \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe written facility emergency response plan incorporates RMP release scenarios.  The facility actively works with the Greater Mobile Emergency Planning Committee (GMEPC) to coordinate emergency response training and drills at the plant site.  Selected elements of the plan are incorporated into the Mobile County Emergency Action Plan, which is maintained by the GMEPC.  The facility also works with the other members of the LeMoyne Industrial Park (LIP), and maintains an incident command protocol for emergency preparedness.  We are prepared to respond to accidental releases.  Employees participate in emergency response drills, attend annual fire training at professional fire schools, maintain fire/ spill response equipment, staff an on-site 24 hour per day emergency response team, train our contractors on plant prevention systems and process information, and train employees to respond to medical/first resp"

Supervisors and key personnel also receive additional incident command and spill response training.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no RMP releases in the last five years (i.e. no on-site, off-site injuries, property damage or environmental damage, or off-site evacuations resulting from a chemical release.)\n\nRevisions From the 2004 RMP Resubmittal\nArkema revisited the worst-case and alternate case modeling to validate and update distances to endpoint, as appropriate.  For the chlorine worst-case scenario, we modeled the endpoint based on EPA RMP modeling guidance for wastewater facilities, that indicates that urban surface roughness facilities with a worst-case chlorine railcar release would have a 14-mile distance to endpoint.  We revised impacted population estimates, using LANDVIEW Version 6, to accommodate the revised modeling.  The toxics alternate case model was also adjusted slightly to accommodate updated plan operating procedures and local conditions.\nThe quantity of chlorine has been increased to allow for the potential inventory of up to four railcars depending on production fluctuations, and also influenced by the fact that storage of chlorine railcars in downtown Mobile will not be permitted in the future.\n\nPredictive Filing\nThe toxics alternate case and flammables worst case include predictive filing to incorporate construction of a school, scheduled to be completed after filing of this RMP, at or near the distance to endpoint for these two cases."
