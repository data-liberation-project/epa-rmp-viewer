      "SummaryText": "Gunslinger Pad 371 Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\r\n\r\nColdstream Energy provides a midstream solution for processing natural gas using a mechanical refrigeration unit (MRU). Use of the MRU allows for maximizing natural gas liquids (NGLs) and reducing flare volumes and emissions. Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. (Slawson) is leasing one of Coldstream Energy's MRU systmes for use at its Gunslinger Pad 371 facility. With the MRU, condensate and NGLs are extracted from the natural gas and stored on site. The extracted NGLs include a mixutre of ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. These are considered flammable substances under Title 40 Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68). The recovered condensate and NGLs will be stored onsite in five 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks (3 for condensate and 2 for NGLs) until they are sold via truck transport. Risk Management Plans (RMPs) must be prepared for processes that store these types of flammable substances in amounts greater than 10,000 lbs. The NGL tanks associated with the MRU store more than 10,000 lbs of flammable mixture, so an RMP is required for the flammable mixture. There are no listed toxic substances exceeding their respective threshold quantities as listed in 40 CFR 68 stored at the facility.\r\n\r\nThis facility qualifies as a Program Level 1 facility based on its accident history and worst-case scenario hazard assessment.  Since it is a newly constructed facility, there is no accident history associated with the site. The worst-case scenario for this facility is the failure of an NGL storage tank and the release of its entire contents. EPA's RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst-case scenario endpoints. There are no public receptors within the radius of the worst-case scenario. Since the facility falls under a Program Level 1 RMP, an alternative release scenario was not explored.\r\n\r\nTo comply with the Program Level 1 requirements, all employees"
