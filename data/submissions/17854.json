The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.   Representatives of the Houston Fire Department visit this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to contain any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThis is a completely remodeled facility and has not had any reportable accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system since it's  startup in 1999.\n\nIn regards to the worst and alternative case scenario's for ammonia, both release scenarios will reach offsite receptors.\n\nIn all cases of a potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected is dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc."

      "SummaryText": "The Park Ten Foods facility located in Houston, Texas is a pork processing facility.  The primary purpose of this facility is to process raw pork into food products for distribution to retailers.\n\nAmmonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia,  safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program is in place at the facility. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State and Local codes.  The facility was completely remodeled in 1999 which included replacing the high pressure ammonia receiver with a new tank and the majority of the piping system.  The remodeling provides newer equipment and the benefits associated with new facilities. This food processing facility complies with EPA\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State and Local codes and regulations.\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program. This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and  comprehensive employee training to insure equipment integrity. The facility does have a program in place to replace Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upo"
