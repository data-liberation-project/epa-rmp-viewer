The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  As a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require for facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan to include hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant.\n\nFacility Overview\n\nThe Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex producing anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  The complex will produce for market approximately 650,000 tons of UAN and 180,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually for use as agricultural fertilizers.  The design of the facility, which started production in January 2001, incorporates state-of-art safety and environmental controls for the protection of the employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nThe facility consists of an air separation unit, a gasification unit, an ammonia synthesis unit, and an UAN unit.  The air separation unit, while located on our site, is independently owned and operated by BOC Gases.  The air separation unit makes high purity oxygen and nitrogen for use in the g"

In addition, BOC markets these gases along with argon to off-site customers. \n\nThe gasification unit produces hydrogen gas using the Texaco Hydrogen Generation Process.  The gasifier produces raw hydrogen and carbon oxides by the partial oxidation of petroleum coke with oxygen in the presence of water.  The petroleum coke will be provided primarily by the neighboring Coffeyville Resources refinery and supplemented with coke from other locations.  The hydrogen is purified by shift conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, and pressure swing absorption of trace contaminants.  \n\nThe ammonia synthesis unit reacts the hydrogen from the gasification unit with nitrogen from the air separation unit to make anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is either sold for direct fertilizer applications or upgraded for UAN solutions.  Ammonia along with by-product carbon dioxide from the gasification unit is used to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce weak nitric acid solution that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate.  The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product. Ammonia and UAN solutions can be shipped to the farmers by both truck and railcars.  On-site storage tanks have been constructed to safely hold the ammonia and UAN products until the farmers are ready to apply the fertilizers.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nCoffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.  We are pursuing elimination or reduction of our use of toxic substances and to minimize our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.

By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace, and improve the environment.\n\nThe above goals were applied to the design and construction of the Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers Plant.  The gasification process substitutes high grade feedstock, natural gas, with a low-grade feedstock, petroleum coke.  Petroleum coke is the end product from the condensation process in oil cracking.  Refineries have difficulties finding a market for their coke due to its poor fuel characteristics.  A conventional natural gas based ammonia plant would consume 28,000 cubic feet for every ton of ammonia produced.  Coffeyville Nitrogen chose to utilize Texaco Hydrogen Generation Process using coke as a feedstock.  Substituting coke for natural gas conserves over 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, which can be better used for home heating and electrical power generation.  Constructing the facility next to a refinery both the energy required to transport the coke.\n\nThe environmental design objective for this plant was to achieve significant emission reduction compared to the conventional nitrogen plant.  No hazardous solids will be produced during normal operations.  The water effluent will be clean enough to enter the Coffeyville's municipal water treatment system.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe gasification unit, ammonia synthesis unit and the UAN solution unit, along with the associated product ammonia storage and handling areas, constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.

There has not been any accidental releases with an RMP off-site impact.\n\nSynopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Plan rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility the regulated substances in the toxic class are ammonia and chlorine.  The regulated substance in the flammable class is synthesis gas, which includes hydrogen.  The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a worst case flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternate scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general, must also be presented.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless"

      "SummaryText": " smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in the atmospheric storage tank.  The quantity for the tank is 20,000 tons.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of an instantaneous catastrophic failure of a tank.  The rate of ammonia released is calculated from the vaporization rate from the liquid ammonia pool contain by the storage dike. A publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events modeled this unlikely event. This scenario has an off site impact.  Details of the results of this modeling are provided elsewhere in the Risk Management Plan Submittal. \n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the worst case as the rule defines it; failure of ammonia storage present at the site where ammonia is stored at higher pressure, but much lower quantities was also modeled.  In addition, a worst case failure of chlorine containers was similarly modeled.  Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the probability of such an event as described by the worst case is extremely low.  Many identically constructed and similar size tanks are in existence all over the world and have been in service for many decades without structural failure. Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nCoffeyville Nitrogen has taken extraordinary precautions to insure the atmospheric storage tank will never structurally fail.  The storage tank is completely enclosed in a second tank"

If the inside wall or floor of the interior storage tank should spontaneously fail the exterior tank will provide complete containment of the ammonia.  The entire vessel is resting on concrete pilings, isolating the tank floor from the ground protecting it from water and ice.  Due to the requirements of the regulation, these safety features could not be considered when calculating the worst case release event.\n\nThe worst case release event also is predicated on the assumption there would be no mitigating response during the release.  Atmospheric storage tanks leak very slowly compared to pressurize tanks, which in a real release event, allows time for mitigating actions. \n\nWorst Case Flammable\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the worst case for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia synthesis loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look up Tables. Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small. This scenario has an off site impact.  Impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nUnlike most conventional ammonia plants, the Coffeyville Nitrogen plant has all major loop relief valves discharge to a flare, significantly reducing the probability of a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics \n\n    Ammonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.

Modeled impact distance is substantially lower for more reasonable, but not necessarily likely, release events. This scenario has an off site impact.\n\n    Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used at several locations in this plant as a biocidal agent for cooling water systems, much as it is also used in swimming pools.  It is used as a gas from one ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed is failure of the connecting tubing from the cylinder and release of gaseous chlorine.
