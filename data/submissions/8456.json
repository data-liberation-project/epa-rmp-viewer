McCarron is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing filtration, sedimentation, and disinfectant.  McCarron\u0012s average daily production is 50 MGD with a typical range of 42 MGD to 95 MGD and a maximum of 144 MGD.  The quantity of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia used at the facility is greater than the Threshold Quantities of 2,500 pounds and 10,000 pounds respectively, which is EPA\u0012s criteria for requiring the development and submittal of information found in this RMP.\n\nChlorine and ammonia are considered hazardous by EPA standards.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable for water treatment, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the impact or threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the chemicals; combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is this facility\u0012s intent to uphold industry standards in the operation of the facility and  it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We have designed and constructed a state-of-the-art facility employing numerous release identification and prevention measures.  If an emergency were to occur, our in-house staff are trained and equipped to perform isolation measures and secure leaking systems.  We have also coordinated with the St. Paul Fire Department and requested that they respond to emergencies at our facility.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary purpose of the chlorine and ammonia at this facility is"

The liquid chlorine passes from the rail car storage, through one-inch black iron piping and into 1 or more of the 3 vaporization units.  After being gasified, it passes through a vacuum regulator, which transitions the chlorine transfer line from a pressurized line to a vacuum feeding line before the chlorine is fed into the water supply.  Physical access to the chlorine tanker car room and chlorination room is restricted by locked doors with only limited maintenance and operator staff having keys to these areas. \n\nAmmonia is received by truck and stored in two 9,230 gallon tank.  Similarly, it passes through piping to a nearby room containing vaporizers, which vaporizes the ammonia.  The gaseous ammonia then flows through the ammonianator and into the water supply.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Scenario (WCS) - Release of the entire contents of the largest single container or piping configuration of chlorine would be 180,000 pounds.  For WCS, according to EPA\u0012s RMP Guidance Document criteria (EPA 550-B-98-010), the distance to toxic endpoint for this worst-case scenario is 14 miles.  The facility is located in a heavily-populated urban area, with an estimated population of 1,300,000 persons living within the 14 mile radius.  The WCS also reaches several environmental receptors as defined by the standard.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS) for chlorine -  A release of 1.0 lb. per minute of chlorine results in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles.  This reaches the nearest public receptor (residential housing)\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS) for ammonia - A release of 5 lb. per minute of ammonia results in a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.  This reaches the nearest public receptor (residential housing).\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility"

St. Paul takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes.  Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect the covered processes are all considered.  By conducting thorough evaluations, accidental releases are prevented and the consequences of releases are minimized.\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the RMP standard, St. Paul intends to prevent releases of hazardous substances and minimize the impacts of accidental releases into locations that could expose employees, the community or the environment to serious hazards.  Our program addresses each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n( Maintaining Process Safety Information (PSI): St. Paul maintains up-to-date technical information about safe operating limits of the components and the associated hazards of the chemicals involved.\n( Conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA):  St. Paul performs technical analyses of the plant\u0012s processes in order to anticipate what might go wrong and recommend approaches to minimize the possibilities and affects of such occurrences.\n( Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): We have written technical and administrative procedures used to operate the plant safely.\n( Training:  St. Paul provides employees with information necessary to ensure safe operation.\n( Mechanical Integrity:  We ensures proper maintenance of the process equipment on an ongoing basis.\n( Management of Change (MOC):  St. Paul analyzes changes in process equipment, procedures and personnel to understand the impact of those changes in the safe operation of our plant.\n( Pre-Startup Safety Review:  We ensure all necessary elements for operating a safe process are in place prior to introducing the hazardous chemical into a \u0013new\u0014 or"

St. Paul has also developed a risk management system which identifies specific job positions and responsibilities to ensure proper management and implementation of this RMP.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine, ammonia, or other toxic/extremely hazardous chemicals in the past 5 years, which have resulted in off-site consequences such as personal injury, death, or response/ restoration activities.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe rely on our trained, in-house staff and on-site equipment for initial response (if safe to do so) and acquire backup support from the St. Paul Fire Department as needed.
