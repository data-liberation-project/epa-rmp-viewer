This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes and the fact that the Maysville Gas Plant is currently an OSHA VPP Star Facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Maysville Gas Plant, located in Maysville Oklahoma, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce Propane, Normal Butane, Isobutane, Ethane, Methane, and Gasoline Condensate petroleum products from natural gas. The Maysville Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including:\n     - Methane\n     - Ethane\n     - Propane\n     - Isobutane\n     - Normal Butane\n     - IsoPentane\n     - Pentane\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Maysville Gas Plant.  Processes at the Maysville Gas Plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Maysville Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemica"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Maysville Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way to address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Maysville Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/ configuration information. The Maysville Gas Plant currently has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Coordinator on site that assists in maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Operator Procedures Manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g."

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \nThe Maysville Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\nThe Maysville Gas Plant uses hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's) which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the tea"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary through the management of change procedure to reflect the changes. In addition, the Maysville Gas Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Maysville Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.

Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. This may require that a management of change team review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Maysville Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that prop"

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Maysville Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits. Any audit findings are developed by the audit team and forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nProcesses at the Maysville Gas Plant involve hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation. Following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Maysville Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\n\nS"
