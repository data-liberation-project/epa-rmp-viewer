              "Description": "HEP Javelina accident prevention programs encompass four different areas: design, operation, maintenance, and auditing. The facility is subject to and maintains compliance with the OSHA PSM regulations. Some of the elements of the Javelina accident prevention program are outlined below. Designing for Safety: Industry standard RAGAGEP are used in design of all PSM/RMP covered process equipment. Flammable gas, hydrogen sulfide monitors, infrared and video cameras provide early warning in case of leaks. A system of alarms, interlocks, and automated safety shutdowns assists operators with maintaining process parameters within safe operating limits. Pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressure. Operating Safely: Operators are trained, tested, and qualified according to OSHA standards, using a system of classroom, field, and computer based training, followed up with written and oral testing, observation and demonstration. Operational parameters are continually monitored by computerized control systems and operators. Operating procedures are evaluated annually and updated with insight gained from Process    Hazard Analyses as well as PSE/DEI incidents and near misses. Operators follow approved procedures and completed procedures are reviewed by management regularly. Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted before starting new or significantly modified equipment, and before any unit or plant startup following major maintenance. Maintaining the Plant: Inspection, testing, and preventative maintenance intervals are set according to industry standard RAGAGEP for all PSM/RMP covered equipment. Maintenance personnel are trained, experienced, and qualified. A computer-based maintenance system is used to track work orders and work permits (including hot work and confined space) are used to control maintenance work on process equipment. Auditing Operations: Safety audits are conducted periodically. Safety meetings are conducted at least monthly. Safety equipment is tested monthly. Incidents are investigated and corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence. Independent loss prevention inspections are conducted. PHAs have been conducted on all processes and are being redone or revalidated on a rotating schedule. Internal PSM audits are conducted on 3 year intervals.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHEP Javelina Company, LLC has demonstrated in its 32 years of operation a commitment to safety and compliance as related to plant personnel, neighbors, and environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that are invested in facility maintenance and capital improvements, accident prevention, personnel training, and emergency response preparedness. Safety is of prime consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of all processes and equipment. Javelina's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and to be prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any releases which may occur.   Detailed procedures designed to fulfill this policy are found in the following documents:\n\n-    Javelina Plant Emergency Action Plan\n\n-    HEP Process Safety Management Manual\n\n-    HEP Safety Procedures Manual\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJavelina is a refinery off-gas (ROG) processing facility. Refinery off-gas is produced as a by-product of several refining processes and is typically burned as fuel gas or flared. Javelina recycles the more valuable components of the gas while returning a methane rich fuel gas to the refineries. Javelina produces purity hydrocarbon products, hydrogen used by refineries to treat fuel products to meet required sulfur specifications, and olefins used in downstream chemical and plastics manufacturing. Each of the six refineries in the Corpus Christi area produce off-gas, but not in sufficient volumes at each refinery to economically justify individual ROG facilities like Javelina. In addition to economic benefits, the Javelina plant adds stability to operations and reduces emissions from all the Corpus Christi refineries by providing a steady heating value fuel gas that has a reduced olefin and sulfur content.  \n\n\n\nJavelina is capable of processing approximately 140"

Javelinas product streams are hydrogen, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butane/natural gasoline. \n\n\n\nThe Javelina facility does not contain any toxic chemicals listed in 40 CFR A?68 above the threshold quantities. The facility does not store large quantities of regulated flammable substances, but the processing equipment does contain several of the regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantities listed in Table 3 of A?68.130. These substances include butane (mixture of n- butane and isobutane), ethylene, propylene, ethane, propane, hydrogen, and methane.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario at the Javelina facility involves the release of a mixture of ethane and ethylene from the C2 Splitter. The C2 Splitter is a fractionation tower designed to separate ethylene from ethane. It is 276 feet tall, 12? feet in diameter, and contains approximately 280,000 lbs of an ethane/ethylene mixture (30% ethylene, 70% ethane) at maximum liquid height. For the worst case analysis, this entire quantity was assumed to be released as a vapor over a ten minute period, with a resulting vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nUsing the equations from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (equation C-1), the distance to 1 psi overpressure is calculated as 2,800 feet (0.53 miles) from the source.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the Javelina facility involves an ethylene leak due to a flange separation on the suction side of the ethylene product pumps. This leak was assumed to release 16,500 pounds of ethylene over a ten-minute period. Although the ethylene in the plant is a liquid at this point, it was assumed to instantly vaporize for the purposes of this analysis. The resulting vapor cloud was assumed to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nThe distance to 1 psi overpressure for this scenario was al"

The distance to a 1 psi overpressure is calculated as 735 feet (0.14 miles) from the source.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Javelina accident prevention programs encompass four different areas: design, operation,\n\nmaintenance, and auditing. The facility is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations and has developed  a program to maintain compliance with those regulations. Some of the elements of the Javelina accident prevention program are outlined below.\n\nDesigning for Safety\n\n-    Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity\n\n-    Flammable gas and Hydrogen Sulfide monitors provide early warning in case of leaks\n\n-    Vessels are equipped with level, pressure, and temperature alarms\n\n-    Pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressure\n\nOperating Safely\n\n-    Operators are trained, tested, and qualified according to Occupational Safety & Health     \n\nAdministration standards\n\n-    The process is continually monitored by computerized control systems and operators\n\n-    Operational procedures are based on Process Hazards Analyses\n\n-    Operators follow approved procedures\n\n-    Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted before starting new or significantly modified equipment\n\n\n\nMaintaining the Plant\n\n-    Maintenance personnel are trained, experienced, and qualified\n\n-    Maintenance personnel are an important part of the plant safety programs\n\n-    A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance work on process equipment\n\n-    Preventative inspection and testing of critical equipment is performed on a scheduled basis\n\nAuditing Operations\n\n-    Safety audits are conducted periodically\n\n-    Safety meetings are conducted at least monthly\n\n-    Safety equipment is inspected monthly\n\n-    Accidents are investigated and correc"
