      "SummaryText": "The El Segundo Generating Station (ESGS) is a natural gas-fired electric generating station consisting of two operating units, Units 3 and 4, each rated at 335 megawatts (MW).  Each unit relies on an air pollution control device, known as a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) device, which utilizes aqueous ammonia as the reducing agent in the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen gas that is exhausted from natural gas combustion process.  As of the date of this submittal, ESGS is in the commissioning phase of the El Segundo Energy Center (ESEC) project that will expand the generating capacity by adding two new power blocks with four new generating units (Units 5, 6, 7 and 8) to the existing Units 3 & 4 power blocks.  Two of the new generating units will be natural-gas combustion units (Units 5 & 7) and will utilize a new pipeline (Units 5 & 7 Pipeline) that will be connected to the existing aqueous ammonia underground storage tank (UST).  This RMP update incorporates the ESEC Modifications into the Aqueous Ammonia System based on the available engineering designs.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is supplied to the SCR devices by the Aqueous Ammonia System.  This process is the only covered process at ESGS and is subject to both federal and California Program 2 requirements.  The 29.4% aqueous ammonia is delivered to the UST by tank trucks operated by the chemical supplier.  Operating procedures require an ESGS operator to be present throughout the unloading process and be ready to respond to concerns.\r\n\r\nThe UST consists of a 20,000-gallon, double-walled, FRP clad, carbon steel tank designed to the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII.  It is equipped with liquid level and overfill prevention, pressure relief valves, vacuum breaker, flame arrestor, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  A continuous leak detection system is provided with interstitial liquid sensors at each end of the tank bottom and local vapor detectors that are continuously mo"

The UST contains three supply pumps (one active and two standby, each with a maximum capacity of 7 gallons per minute) that transfer the aqueous ammonia into the pipeline.  \r\n\r\nThe existing Units 3 & 4 Pipeline consists of a 2-inch stainless steel piping designed to ANSI B31.1, with pressure relief valves, flow solenoid shut-off valves, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  The pipeline is predominately aboveground except for two portions that extend under the site roads.  Underground piping is contained within carbon steel piping with continuous liquid leak detection monitoring of the annular space.  The aqueous ammonia is delivered to the two SCR vaporization skids where it passes through a duplex strainer and a shutoff valve before splitting into two separate lines that each feed one of two vaporizers on each SCR skid.  Hot boiler (dilution) air is directed through the two vaporizers where atomizing nozzles spray the aqueous ammonia into the hot boiler air which evaporates the ammonia.  The air/ammonia mixture is then injected into the flue gas of each unit's boiler that then flows into SCR reactor.  The SCR reactor contains a horizontal flow catalyst bed where the NOx reacts with ammonia to form inert nitrogen gas and water that are exhausted through the stacks.\r\n\r\nThe existing Chemical Feed System is operated manually on a batch basis.  An operator must be present to hold open the dead-man valve on the aqueous ammonia supply line during filling of the transparent acrylic metering cylinder.  Once filled, the operator releases the dead-man valve which springs closed.  The operator then opens one of the two hand gate valves to gravity feed the aqueous ammonia into either the Unit 3 or Unit 4 mix tanks that contain dilution water (two 50 gallon vertical carbon steel tanks).  The resulting mixture from the mix tanks is then pumped into the suction boiler feed pump and/or discharge condensate pump.  \r\n\r\nThe new Units 5 &"

Continuous leak detection monitoring consist of a leak detecting cable within the annular space between the service piping and the containment piping along the entire length that will detect and locate a liquid leak.  The pipeline will deliver the aqueous ammonia to the two new SCR vaporization skids that are designed similar to the existing Units 3 & 4 SCR Skids.\r\n\r\n1)  Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies.  ESGS adheres to the safety and environmental policies of NRG and the related Safety Program and Environmental Policies and Procedures Manual.  Policy dictates the commitment to conducting its operations in a manner that meets or exceeds all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Promoting compliance and environmental protection is the responsibility of each officer and employee. ESGS management continually stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee communications, training programs, written procedures and instructions.  This includes this RMP and the referenced documents.\r\n \r\n2) Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps. ESGS has developed a management system to plan, organize, implement and control this RMP and the Aqueous Ammonia System.  The Station Manager is the primary person with this responsibility.  Station operators are trained on the RMP elements, the process equipment, its monitoring, normal operation, and u"

A preventative maintenance program provides that the Aqueous Ammonia System equipment and instrumentation is inspected, tested, and/or maintained to function as designed.  Modifications to the Aqueous Ammonia System require evaluation as defined by the Management of Change (MOC) procedure by knowledgeable and responsible parties to verify that they are made as designed and that new or modified safety and operating procedures as well as training is developed and implemented, as needed.  New system descriptions, plans, procedures and training for the ESEC Modifications are under development as of the date of this RMP and will be completed prior to the startup of the new process equipment.  \r\n\r\nThe design of the Aqueous Ammonia System is to the recognized and generally accepted good engineering practice using corrosion-resistance materials that are compatible with NH4OH.  Select safety features include the following:\r\na. Continuous monitoring of critical process parameters by the Control Room (e.g., pressure, temperature, liquid flow, leak detection, etc.); \r\nb. Stainless steel pipeline withing secondary containment piping with continuous leak detection monitoring of the annular space for the UST and pipeline segments outside the power blocks; \r\nc.

ESGS maintains written plans and procedures and provides training on the expected hazards and actions employees should take in response to an emergency, including an accidental release of NH4OH.  The emergency response program provides for evacuation, initial assessment, local and public agency notifications, emergency planning and coordination with outside agencies, personnel roles and the Incident Command System, and containment and removal actions, when safe to perform.  The emergency response program defines the highest priority as protecting human health and is generally limited to defensive actions that station employees can perform safely.  ESGS will rely on the El Segundo Fire Department and other local agencies as well as NRG contractors.  A review and/or update of the emergency plans were included in the RMP update.
