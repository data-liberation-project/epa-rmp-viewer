              "Description": "Following is a summary of the Program 2 Prevention Program requirements:\n\n\n\n? 68.48 Safety Information.  Safety information has been compiled pertaining to the Aqueous Ammonia System to facilitate the understanding of the safety-related aspects of the equipment and processes, the safety data sheets, the limits thus placed on operations, and the accepted standards and codes that have been adopted.  ESGS maintains this RMP and the related plans, procedures, drawings and other related information in the onsite Administration Library and/or on the NRG computer server.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of 29.4% NH4OH at ESGS will be approximately 18,401 gallons (137,639 pounds) contained in the storage tank and pipelines. A summary of the process design limits (upper and lower) are included in the RMP for tank liquid level, pressure, temperature and liquid flow.\n\n\n\nEquipment specifications, codes and standards are included in an Appendix to the RMP.  The Aqueous Ammonia System design incorporates recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices using corrosion-resistant materials compatible with NH4OH, and features to minimize damage from significant hazards that could be caused by external events as identified in Section 6.2.  Safety features of the Aqueous Ammonia System include the following:\n\n\n\na) Critical process parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, liquid flow, leak detection, etc.) are continuously monitored by the Control Room that is monitored 24 hours daily by operators that can remotely shut-off critical flow control valves or the supply pumps in the event of an upset condition or a release.\n\n\n\nb) The UST design is to the ASME Pressure Vessel Code and the applicable requirements of the California Underground Storage Tank regulation, including pressure relief, vent flame arrestor, secondary containment, continuous interstitial leak detection monitoring, overfill controls, etc. \n\n \n\nc) Both the Units 3 & 4 Pipeline and Units 5 & 7 Pipeline designs are to ANSI B31.1 and consist of heavy gauge stainless steel that is highly corrosion resistant and compatible with aqueous ammonia.  The rated capacity of the piping exceeds the process design limits and includes pressure relief valves at the supply pumps, shut-off and flow control valves, etc.  Containment pipe with continuous leak detection of the annular space provides secondary containment for the carrier piping in portions outside the power blocks and in the underground portions.  \n\n\n\nd) The NH4OH piping on the SCR Skids is also designed to ANSI B31.1 and consists of heavy gauge stainless steel piping.  The Control Room continuously monitors critical process parameters (pressure, flow, temperature) and can remotely shut-off the NH4OH supply flow using the DCS.\n\n\n\ne) The Unit 3 Chemical Feed Station has heavy gauge stainless steel piping designed to ANSI B31.1 and the vessels are either stainless steel or acrylic.  NH4OH flow from the pipeline requires an operator to manually hold open a dead-man valve and monitor the filling of the transparent acrylic metering cylinder. \n\n\n\n? 68.50 Hazard Review.  The initial hazard review of the Existing Process took place in 1999 using the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methodology.  Revalidation PHA reviews were completed in 2004 and 2010.  The initial PHA of the ESEC Modifications was completed September 5, 2012.  The PHA's considered the possible external events that could impact the Aqueous Ammonia System, including earthquakes.\n\n\n\n? 68.52 Operating Procedures.  Design, operation and maintenance procedures are detailed in the system descriptions, drawings and operating manuals and identify the core operating procedures, including pre-startup inspection, normal startup, normal and emergency shutdown, troubleshooting and the instrument set-points.  In addition, ESGS Orders and Procedures supplement the ESGS operating manuals with written procedures that provide instruction to operators, maintenance personnel, and NH4OH truck drivers for safely conducting tasks and activities.  At the time of this RMP update, new system descriptions, plans, procedures for the ESEC Modifications were being developed.  Prior to the startup of the new process equipment, a pre-startup safety review of the SCR system will be completed to confirm that the construction is completed in accordance with the design plans and that the needed maintenance and operating procedures are in-place and adequate.  \n\n\n\n? 68.54 Training.  ESGS has instituted a comprehensive training program designed to ensure competency for personnel with responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the Aqueous Ammonia System.  The training approach is a combination of both on-the-job training and classroom training to familiarize workers with the equipment, operating procedures and requirements.  Plant managers, supervisors, and experienced operators provide on-the-job training to workers to provide them with the knowledge, skills, and abilities that they need to safely conduct their duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures for the Aqueous Ammonia System.  Plant managers, supervisors, and experienced operators provide on-the-job training to workers to provide them with the knowledge, skills, and abilities that they need to safely conduct their duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures for the Aqueous Ammonia System.  \n\n\n\n? 68.56 Maintenance.  The system descriptions and operating and instruction manuals identify the maintenance required for the equipment, including the equipment manufacturer?s manuals for reference.  Similar documentation is under development for the ESEC Modifications and is to be complete prior to the startup.  The Technical & Maintenance Manager is responsible for ensuring the proper maintenance of the equipment for reliability and developing safe procedures for performing the required tasks.  Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency of inspections and tests of equipment are consistent with applicable manufacturers? recommendations, industry standards, good engineering practices and prior operating experience.  ESGS employs a computer software program to identify required preventative maintenance in the form of work orders and track its completion.  The equipment associated with the ESEC Modifications will be incorporated in a similar manner.\n\n\n\n? 68.58 Compliance Audits.  The most recent Compliance Audit was completed on October 5, 2011 on the Existing Process by Ammonia Process Safety Management.  At the time of this RMP update, the recommendations identified in the compliance report were undergoing evaluation by ESGS, which, once completed, will result in the identification of appropriate completion date(s).  A pre-startup safety review of the ESEC Modifications will be completed to confirm the following information prior to the startup:  construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; and training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.  \n\n\n\n? 68.60 Incident Investigations.  The RMP requires that an incident investigation will begin within 48 hours for any accident involving aqueous ammonia that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release.  At the conclusion of the investigation, a report will be prepared that will include the following information:  1) Date of incident? 2) Date investigation began; 3) Description of the incident; 4) Factors that contributed to the incident; and, 5) Findings and recommendations resulting from the investigation.  The findings and recommendations will be promptly addressed.  Resolutions and corrective actions will be documented and reviewed with all affected personnel.  A copy of the incident investigation report will be retained for 5 years.  At the time of this RMP update, there were no records of incident investigations, as there have been no incident investigations during the last 5 years at ESGS.  When an incident investigation occurs, items resulting from the investigation will be addressed promptly. \n\n ",

      "SummaryText": "The El Segundo Generating Station (ESGS) is a natural gas-fired electric generating station consisting of two operating units, Units 3 and 4, each rated at 335 megawatts (MW).  Each unit relies on an air pollution control device, known as a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) device, which utilizes aqueous ammonia as the reducing agent in the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen gas that is exhausted from natural gas combustion process.  As of the date of this submittal, ESGS is in the commissioning phase of the El Segundo Energy Center (ESEC) project that will expand the generating capacity by adding two new power blocks with four new generating units (Units 5, 6, 7 and 8) to the existing Units 3 & 4 power blocks.  Two of the new generating units will be natural-gas combustion units (Units 5 & 7) and will utilize a new pipeline (Units 5 & 7 Pipeline) that will be connected to the existing aqueous ammonia underground storage tank (UST).  This RMP update incorporates the ESEC Modifications into the Aqueous Ammonia System based on the available engineering designs.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is supplied to the SCR devices by the Aqueous Ammonia System.  This process is the only covered process at ESGS and is subject to both federal and California Program 2 requirements.  The 29.4% aqueous ammonia is delivered to the UST by tank trucks operated by the chemical supplier.  Operating procedures require an ESGS operator to be present throughout the unloading process and be ready to respond to concerns.\n\n\n\nThe UST consists of a 20,000-gallon, double-walled, FRP clad, carbon steel tank designed to the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII.  It is equipped with liquid level and overfill prevention, pressure relief valves, vacuum breaker, flame arrestor, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  A continuous leak detection system is provided with interstitial liquid sensors at each end of the tank bottom and local vapor detectors that are continuously mo"

The UST contains three supply pumps (one active and two standby, each with a maximum capacity of 7 gallons per minute) that transfer the aqueous ammonia into the pipeline.  \n\n\n\nThe existing Units 3 & 4 Pipeline consists of a 2-inch stainless steel piping designed to ANSI B31.1, with pressure relief valves, flow solenoid shut-off valves, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  The pipeline is predominately aboveground except for two portions that extend under the site roads.  Underground piping is contained within carbon steel piping with continuous liquid leak detection monitoring of the annular space.  The aqueous ammonia is delivered to the two SCR vaporization skids where it passes through a duplex strainer and a shutoff valve before splitting into two separate lines that each feed one of two vaporizers on each SCR skid.  Hot boiler (dilution) air is directed through the two vaporizers where atomizing nozzles spray the aqueous ammonia into the hot boiler air which evaporates the ammonia.  The air/ammonia mixture is then injected into the flue gas of each unit's boiler that then flows into SCR reactor.  The SCR reactor contains a horizontal flow catalyst bed where the NOx reacts with ammonia to form inert nitrogen gas and water that are exhausted through the stacks.\n\n\n\nThe existing Chemical Feed System is operated manually on a batch basis.  An operator must be present to hold open the dead-man valve on the aqueous ammonia supply line during filling of the transparent acrylic metering cylinder.  Once filled, the operator releases the dead-man valve which springs closed.  The operator then opens one of the two hand gate valves to gravity feed the aqueous ammonia into either the Unit 3 or Unit 4 mix tanks that contain dilution water (two 50 gallon vertical carbon steel tanks).  The resulting mixture from the mix tanks is then pumped into the suction boiler feed pump and/or discharge condensate pump.  \n\n\n\nThe new Units 5 & "

The pipeline will deliver the aqueous ammonia to the two new SCR vaporization skids that are designed similar to the existing Units 3 & 4 SCR Skids.\n\n\n\n1)  Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies.  ESGS adheres to the safety and environmental policies of NRG and the related Safety Program and Environmental Policies and Procedures Manual.  Policy dictates the commitment to conducting its operations in a manner that meets or exceeds all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Promoting compliance and environmental protection is the responsibility of each officer and employee.

      "SummaryText": "  No accidental release of NH4OH or ammonia at significant quantities as defined in the RMP regulation has occurred since the installation of the Aqueous Ammonia System in 1993.\n\n\n\n4)Emergency Response Program.  ESGS maintains written plans and procedures and provides training on the expected hazards and actions employees should take in response to an emergency, including an accidental release of NH4OH.  The emergency response program provides for evacuation, initial assessment, local and public agency notifications, emergency planning and coordination with outside agencies, personnel roles and the Incident Command System, and containment and removal actions, when safe to perform.  The emergency response program defines the highest priority as protecting human health and is generally limited to defensive actions that station employees can perform safely.  ESGS will rely on the El Segundo Fire Department and other local agencies as well as NRG contractors.  A review and/or update of the emergency plans were included in the RMP update.  For the ESEC Modifications, new or updated emergency procedures will be completed prior to the startup of the new equipment. \n\n    \n\n5) Recommendations to Improve Safety [?2735.3(f)].  A specific list of recommendations to improve safety are identified in the RMP that are being further evaluated by ESGS.  These include completing the Pre-Startup Safety Review prior to the startup of the ESEC Modifications to verify that the required installation and the administrative controls (e.g., system descriptions and drawings, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, operator training, emergency procedures, etc.) are satisfactory and complete.
