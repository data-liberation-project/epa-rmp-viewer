      "SummaryText": "Our company strives to keep a safe workplace. Our farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan and prevent any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The activity of this plant involves the storage and transfer of the product.     The maximum quanity stored is 180,000 lbs. Worst case release senario would be a release as a gas over 10 minutes. The potential quanity release could be 132,000 lbs, which is the volume of the largest tank at 85%- as limited by design standards as well as company policy. Distance to end point is 2.50 miles from this plant.  The alternative release scenerio based on industry information could be a release from a pipe or transfer hose break. The distance to end point for this is .83 miles.   There have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years resulting in any injuries, death , evacuation, sheltering in place, or other emergency procedures.  Our emergency plan is designed to minimize risks to employees, the surrounding public, as well as emergency responders. Our company will continue to work with all in the industry to improve and implement any new procedures for the betterment of safety."
