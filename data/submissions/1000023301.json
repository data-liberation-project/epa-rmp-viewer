These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown..  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\tGillespie Ag Services has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\tGillespie Ag Services carries out routine maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 4/16/2011.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\tGillespie Ag Services conducts compliance audits at least once every three years to ensure the ongoing safety of our facility and the community.

All reports of incidents will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nGillespie Ag Services maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  All employees are trained per their responsibilities under this plan.\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Ongoing safety inspections and further employee training are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by 10/16/2011."

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the operation of a farm chemical warehousing/sales operation.  We only have one regulated substance at our facility: Anhydrous Ammonia.  This material is sold and used as a fertilizer for farm crops.\n\nIn addition to the Worst-Case scenario required by regulation, we've conducted an alternative scenario.  Our Worst-Case scenario is the catastrophic failure of our storage tank, where its entire contents are lost over a ten-minute period.  Our alternative scenario involves the failure of a valve that contains low pressure liquid ammonia.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the California Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements set out under CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5. \nThis facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASTM standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our cold storage facility:\n\tGillespie Ag Services. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nOur facility has conducted comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
