      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nRisk Management Plan \nIndian Springs Gas Plant\nTeco Gas Processing Company\n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Teco Gas Processing Company?s (Teco?s) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances; however, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release and emergency personnel (when appropriate) will respond to ensure the safety of our employees and the public. \n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant, located 16.2 miles east of Livingston on Highway 190 in Polk County, Texas,  operates processes to extract liquid petroleum products from the natural gas stream. This liquid product consists of methane, ethane, propane, and butane, which are regulated flammable substances. In order to establish as safe of an environment as possible for employees and the public, Teco has elected to maintain minimum inventories (well below the threshold quantity) of toxic substances. \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the surge tank containing 110,000 pounds of  product in which ethane is the major constituent. The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile. Although Teco has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credits for passive and/or active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \n\nThe surge tank was built and installed to ASME Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII Standards. It is equipped with a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) or Relief Valve. The PSV and all other"

      "SummaryText": " safety devices are function tested once per calendar year not to exceed 15 month intervals. These tests are conducted as part of the mechanical integrity element of Teco?s PSM program, which the plant has had in place for the past several years. Ultrasonic testing is also performed on non-insulated piping and vessels in the plant to determine that the wall thickness of the piping and vessels meets service requirements. \n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from a 1-minute release of product from a seal/packing failure at the product pumps, releasing 180 pounds of ethane.  Such a release is expected to be isolated by an automatic shutdown valve within one minute (active mitigation).  The valve would receive a signal to close from a gas detection system which monitors the pump area.  The maximum distance to the 1- psi over pressure endpoint for this event is 0.05 mile. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation they are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\nEmployee Participation \n\nTeco?s gas plant employees participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in "

In addition, the gas plant has initiatives under way that address process safety, and employee safety issues. These initiatives include individual safety awards presented for safety excellence during the previous year. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Plant management is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is always readily available to the employees. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, pressure) in a Cause & Effect Diagram. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe gas plant also maintains plant job books, piping and Instrument Drawings (P&ID's) and Electrical Classification Drawings that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures may be necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. In addition, the gas plant maintains a Cause and Effect Diagram that provides information on how each of the process equipment will react to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\nTraining \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator works with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors \n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished prior to beginning work by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices. In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance by use of the contract, or evaluation form to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists (Form 736) to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring ver"
