The catfish plant's ammonia refrigeration system has evolved and been expanded since it was installed in 1993.  The upgrades include some new vessels, compressors, condensers, ammonia detection system, and stainless steel ammonia piping.  The seafood plant is a state of the art facility and also includes all stainless steel piping to prevent corrosion from outside.  Ammonia is non-corrosive to steel piping or stainless steel piping, but steel piping can corrode from outside that could eventually result in a leak.  Initial startup procedures have been developed and reviewed for the new seafood plant's ammonia refrigeration system including a checkoff list will be utilized to assure that all valves are in their correct position (open or closed).  A pre-startup safety review will be conducted prior to startup and the startup will be phased-in over a period of a few weeks for simplicity and safety reasons.  We anticipate the startup to be complete by April 1, 2024.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter-in-place as determined necessary for the particular event.  The Lafayette Fire Department HAZMAT Team will respond if there would be a need or an uncontrollable release event.  Guidry's personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in an actual response if it required Level A suits.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have not been any accidental or reportable incidents at the catfish facility in the last five years."

      "SummaryText": "amount in pipes.  Computer air models were developed based on a worst-case release scenario involving a catastrophic structural failure of the systems High Pressure Ammonia Receivers (Vessels).  The catfish plant's receiver can potentially contain the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel at the facility so its full capacity including the amount of ammonia that could drain back from the condensers and piping are use.  The seafood plant's receiver is larger than the total charge of the facility; therefore, the total quantity of ammonia in the seafood plant is used for the worst-case scenario.  The alternate case scenario is a scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) for the worst-case for the catfish plant is 2.2 miles and for the seafood plant is 2.6 miles.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternate case for both plants is 0.1 mile or less.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe catfish facility developed a prevention program prior to December 22, 2018 that complies with the requirements of OSHA's CFR 29, 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The seafood plant is being built at this time.  The new Seafood Plant ammonia refrigeration system is complete, except the utilities of electric power and water are not complete as of this date (January 24, 2024).  Ammonia (20,000 pounds) has been ordered and will be charged into the seafood plant's high pressure receiver and intercooler/recirculator on January 24, 2024, but only the vapor will be charged into the piping downstream to perform a stink test on the ammonia lines and other equipment until the utilities are compete and the system can be started.  The  PSM and RMP programs, including Operating Procedures, Process Hazard Analysis, and all other Elements have been completed for the seafood plan"

      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe stationary sources are defined as Guidry's Catfish facility and Processor's Inc. seafood facility located at 1093 Henderson Highway, Breaux Bridge, LA.  Guidry's Catfish processes & distributes seafood products throughout the USA.  The facility has two refrigeration systems at this site containing anhydrous ammonia C.A.S. #7664-41-7.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at these two facilities.  The catfish plant's ammonia refrigeration system contains approximately 18,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and the seafood plant's ammonia refrigeration system contains approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The two facilities ammonia refrigeration systems are not connected to each other.  Both facilities exceed OSHA's and EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and therefore fall under the OSHA Process Safety Management program and EPA's Risk Management Plan.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated component shutdowns when unsafe parameters are reached or exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The systems are equipped with ammonia sensors to detect leaks and notify necessary response personnel if the concentration should reach 25 ppm concentration or higher of ammonia.  The systems are also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components or injury to personnel in the unlikely event that pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves would result in a controlled release of the refrigerant through an engineered vent system to the atmosphere and away from personnel, contractors, or visitors.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\nOSHA and EPS define the worst-case release quantity as the greatest of the amount of ammonia held in a vessel or the greatest"
