      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nAs required by 40 CFR 68.155, this risk management plan includes an executive summary that describes the aqueous ammonia storage and transfer process at the Alabama Electric Cooperative\u00bfs James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant.  Aqueous ammonia is used for selective catalytic reduction of the oxides of nitrogen from the facility\u00bfs stack emissions.  The following executive summary outlines the accidental release prevention and emergency response policies, source description and regulated substances handled, worst-case and alternative release scenarios, accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps, five-year accident history, emergency response program, and planned changes to improve safety.\nThe risk management plan also includes the data elements contained within EPA\u00bfs electronic submittal program, RMP*Submit\u00ae.  \nExecutive Summary\nCommitment to Safety\nThe Alabama Electric Cooperative (AEC) has implemented a program to operate the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant in a safe manner, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the aqueous ammonia storage and transfer system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, facility personnel, and the environment.  Safe operation depends upon proper unloading and storage of aqueous ammonia, proper handling of the aqueous ammonia transfer system, and inherent safety features in the design of the aqueous ammonia system.  Safety in the storage and handling of aqueous ammonia is achieved through the use of operating procedures and employee training.  \nAEC works with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, and to develop and implement an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Gantt and Andalusia Fire Departments. \nStationary Sources and R"

      "SummaryText": "egulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities\nAEC\u00bfs primary activity at the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant is electric power generation by the combustion of natural gas.  The facility was constructed in 2001 and has a generating capacity of approximately 500 megawatts (MW).  \nUse of Regulated Substances\nAqueous ammonia is used as a reducing agent to remove emissions of the oxides of nitrogen from the flue gas produced by the facility\u00bfs natural gas combustion turbines. \nQuantities Handled or Stored\nThe James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant stores approximately 24,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia for the selective catalytic reduction process.  The concentration of ammonia solution is 29.5 percent by weight.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant has complied with the requirements of the Risk Management Program Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all equipment systems, as well as of administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using the HAZOP technique.\nFive-year Accident History\nAEC\u00bfs James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant has never had a release of aqueous ammonia resulting in offsite injury or atmospheric dispersion, or in injury to facility personnel on site.\nEmergency Response Program\nAEC has coordinated its emergency response program for the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant with the Andalusia Fire Department\u00bfs Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team, the Gantt Fire Department, the Covington County sheriff\u00bfs department, and the Andalusia hospital.  \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nDuring the hazard review, it was concluded that the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant has installed all necessary equipment and has provided the operating and training procedures required for safe operation of the aqueous ammonia storage and transfer system."
