All employees have been trained on the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia and refreshed on an annual basis.\n\nOur Ammonia facility stores a maximium of 154275 pounds of amhydrous ammoniain a 18,000 gallon staorage tanks and 15 nurse tanks, with the worst case scenario to release 84150 lbs/min \n\n Our facility includes storage tanks, nurse taks, piping and valves, maintained in accordance with local, state, and federal rules and regulations, as well as OSHA's standard such as 29  CFR 1910.111 and NFPA -58. \n\nOur training programs allows us to report that in the last 5 years the facilities mentioned above has been accident free. \n\n This companies Emergency action plan is updated annually and is shared with and discussed with the Longford Fire Department and the Clay County LEPC\n\nThe farmer owners, management and employees of the  Farmers Cooperative Association are committed and dedicated to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the unlaoding from truck, anhydrous ammonia, into our storage tanks and then to transfer from storage tanks into nurse tanks.  These nurse tanks are used by our farmer customers to apply nitrogen to their crops. The maximum quanity stored in our storage tanks is 84150  pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This location has 15 mobile nurse tanks with total possible storage of 70125 pounds, which would make the total location storage 154275  "

Total volume figured by water capacity at 85% with a density of 5.5 lbs/gallon NH3.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 79000 pounds, which represents the volume of our largest tank at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The Local and County Emergency Management have been trained on how to react to a release.\nThe alternative release scenario based on industry records and the most likely potentail incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\nBecause our firm handels anhydrous ammonia, we are regulated by DOT, EPA, OSHA, and The Kansas Department of Agriculture, who inspects our facilities on an annual basis.  These regulation along with the extensive training and standards our company uses, has led us to an excellent safety record.  We have had reportable accidents with annhydrous ammonia in the last five years.  We are very proud of this record.  In the event we would have an ammonia release  we have an emergency response plan which discusses what our personnel are to do.  In addition the training our employees are required to have , addresses ammonia accidents and proper procedures we must take to mitigate any accidental release.\n\nEach year we report to the state, LEPC and to the local fire department what kinds of hazardous materials we are keeping on this site.  In addition we have employees at our facility who are on the volunteer fire departmet which futher helps coordination of our response efforts.\n\nWe strive to maintain our excellent safety record by updating our employee training on an annula basis or as changes are made in the safety processes.  This company has a inspection and maintenace program that allows equipment in ecellent working condition to be maintained for the safety of our coustomers and emplyees."
