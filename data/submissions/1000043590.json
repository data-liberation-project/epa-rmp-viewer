Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are stationed at the plant at all times to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEquistar's primary activity at the Matagorda site is the production of high density polyethylene.  High density polyethylene is utilized in making a variety of plastic products such as grocery bags, plastic cups and plastic containers.  We utilize four (4) regulated substances at Equistar; ethylene, butene, hydrogen, and titanium tetrachloride.  \n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nThe RMP*Comp modeling program was used for each of the chemicals listed above the threshold quantity for our plant.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release of titanium tetrachloride from a delivery truck while unloading.  The scenario involves the release of 45,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under worst case weather conditions, a vapor cloud could form and travel approximately 0.5 miles from the point o"

Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.6 miles is obtained corresponding to an EPA defined endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves the failure of a hose unloading titanium tetrachloride from a delivery truck to a storage tank.  This scenario involves the release of approximately 12,600 pounds of titanium tetrachloride in 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, a vapor cloud could form and travel approximately 0.2 miles from the point of release before the EPA determined toxic endpoint of  0.02 mg/l.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic hydrogen tank rupture due to brittle fracture releasing 26,000lbs of hydrogen to the atmosphere resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an EPA defined endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Inf"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a minimum every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furtherm"

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Equistar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Equistar.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEquistar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEquistar investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEquistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Emergency Response Plan\n\nEquistar carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The facility's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Matagorda County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n"
