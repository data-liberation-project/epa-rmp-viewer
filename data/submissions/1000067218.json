      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\n\n\nPoet Biorefining-Leipsic facility is located \n\napproximately one and a half miles northeast of Leipsic, Ohio.  \n\nPoet Biorefining-Leipsic main product is denatured ethanol for use as \n\nmotor vehicle fuel. Production at the facility was initiated in January 2008.  Poet\n\nBiorefining-Leipsic produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal \n\nis mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to convert to starch to fermentable sugars.  \n\nYeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\n\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 19% alcohol and is distilled,\n\nthen passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous\n\nethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two\n\n2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas\n\ncondensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per\n\nfederal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored (primarily)\n\nin Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 112,800 gallons\n\n(approximately 710,000 pounds), and also in Tank No. 802, which has a\n\ncapacity of 250,000 gallons (approximately 1,574,000 pounds).  NGC is blended\n\nin-line with the ethanol and transferred to vehicles for transport\n\noff-site.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank\n\ntrucks.\n\n\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which\n\nexceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.\n\nThe CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage\n\ntank and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The\n\ndenaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 1.96% to 2.49%.  The\n\ngreatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping\n\nsystem is the quantity in the denaturant storage tank, located in the\n\ncenter containment area of the tank farm.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy and Program\n\n\n\nPoet Biorefining"

In the event of an\n\nemergency, Poet Biorefining - Leipsic's Emergency Coordinator will direct\n\ninternal response activities to the extent they are within the\n\nqualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable\n\nprecautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of\n\nmaterials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees\n\nwithin their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such\n\nresponse does not pose a danger to their health or safety.

Public access to the facility from the\n\nhighway is restricted by a back gate.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting\n\nvehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are\n\non-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video\n\nsurveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based\n\nalarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage\n\ntanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill\n\nmonitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal\n\nconditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible\n\nalarms.  All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage\n\ncontainment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and\n\nCountermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has an excellent record with regard to minimizing"
