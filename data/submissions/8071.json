(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Crossett, AR.  The facility is located off U.S. Highway 82 on Paper Mill Road and is adjacent to several other Georgia-Pacific Corporation plants. The Crossett, AR resin plant manufactures formaldehyde and synthetic resins.  Overall, the facility employs 188 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Crossett, Arkansas plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Crossett Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Crossett Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Crossett Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Crossett Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n7 an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered p"

In fact, the Crossett Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Crossett Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Crossett Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Crossett Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Crossett Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Crossett Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the pub"

GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Crossett Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Crossett Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Regional Safety & Health Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Crossett Plant handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at the plant.\n\n Regulated Substance    Process    Process Quantity*, lbs    RMP Threshold, lbs*\nEpichlorohydrinRMP Program 1    Storage in Unpressurized Tanks    196,968    20,000\nFormaldehyde Solution (50%)RMP Program 3    Storage in Unpressurized Tanks    537,560    15,000\n\n* Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of pure chemical, not of the solution\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Crossett Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Crossett Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \n7 one worst case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 3 processes\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Crossett Plant:\n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes-Toxic Substances - Formaldehyde Solution\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of the largest storage tank, a 112,000 gallon (537,560 lbs of pure formaldehyde) tank.

The U.S. Census indicates that 2,979 people live within this distance from the location of the storage tank; several public receptors are also located within this distance, including the adjacent Georgia-Pacific Corporation Plants and  nearby residences.  No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the overfilling of a formaldehyde storage tank and the spillage of 100 gallons (480 lbs of pure formaldehyde) of solution into the concrete diked area.  Modeling this scenario indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 mile. There are no residences, public receptors or enviromental receptors with this distance of the storage tank.  The distance does encompass areas of adjacent Georgia-Pacific Corporation Plant property.\n\n1.3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in a three storage tanks; a single 330 gallon tank and two 500 gallon tanks.

The distance does encompass areas of adjacent Georgia-Pacific Corporation Plant property.\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince 1993, the Crossett Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nProgram 2requires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for Crossett Plant)\n\nProgram 1none required\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Crossett Plants Program 3 prevention program that address EPAs RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Crossett Plants Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.4.1.1 Process Safety Information-the Crossett Plant maintains a  variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.
