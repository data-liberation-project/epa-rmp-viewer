Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Bossier City Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine and ammonia processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\r\n\r\n4.2\tHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Bossier City Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the Bossier City Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\r\n\r\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Bossier City Water Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\r\n\r\n1. train employees and contractors, and\r\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\r\n\r\n4.4\tTraining\r\n\r\nThe Bossier City Water Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\r\n\r\n4.5\tMaintenance\r\n\r\nThe Bossier City Water Treatment Plant properly maintains the equipment in our processes.
