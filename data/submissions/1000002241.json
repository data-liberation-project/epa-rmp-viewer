Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nOrtec, Inc. is strongly dedicated to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment to safety starts with our senior management staff and filters down throughout our entire organization. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated processes at our facility.  \n\nII. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOrtec, Inc. is a custom chemical manufacturer.  Our primary business includes various adhesives, coating polymers, and similar polymers.  We presently have two regulated toxic substances present at our facility.  These substances are Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] and Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  Both monomers are raw materials used in making our polymers.\n\nAcrylonitrile is stored in a bulk storage tank. \n\nVinyl Acetate monomer is stored in a bulk storage tank.  \n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07. \n\n\nIII.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  Our facility also meets the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  For Acrylonitrile, a pre-startup review was conducted along with specific training by the supplier on the handling of Acrylonitrile.  All of our affected employees are trained yearly on the hazards associated with Acrylonitrile and safe handling practices.  The Vinyl acetate monomer tank system was reviewed and tested.  Employees were trained on the unloading procedures for both Ac"

Only designated employees are qualified to unload Acrylonitrile or Vinyl Acetate monomer into the respective bulk storage tank.  \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nOrtec, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.  We maintain current MSDSs for all our raw materials and products.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and properly controlled.  Depending on the process, we use both the Hazard and Operability Study and Checklist methodologies to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance, safety, and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nOrtec, Inc. maintains written operating procedures in order to safely conduct activities within our covered process.  The procedures for Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate tanker unloading address personal protective equipment requirements, abnormal conditions, and emergency equipment/supplies requirements.  This procedure is regularly reviewed and used by the operators each time an Acrylonitrile tanker or Vinyl acetate monomer tanker is unloaded.  \n\nTraining\nOrtec, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who handle monomers are competent in safe handling practices to protect themselves and their surroundings.  Refresher training is provided on Acrylonitrile handling at least yearly and more frequently as needed.  Training is also provided periodically on Vinyl Acetate handling.  Air monitoring is also c"

The results are posted for all employees to review.  \n\nComprehensive training is also conducted specifically for unloading of Acrylonitrile and Vinyl acetate monomer tankers into our bulk storage tank.  Safety procedures and alarms are reviewed during this training.\n\nAdditionally, employees are trained on RCRA regulations to make them aware of possible environmental impacts.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOrtec, Inc. carries out documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others;  storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Ortec, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.  \n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ortec, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\nOrtec, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nOrtec, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases of the regulated substances over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental reportable release of Acrylonitrile or Vinyl Acetate monomer during this period.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nOrtec, Inc. has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  \n\nPickens County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  Our EHS Coordinator currently serves as the chairperson of the LEPC.  Additionally, representatives from the Easley Fire Department are invited to tour the facility yearly.\n\n\nIIV.   Safety Improvements\nTo ensure more regular training of our employees, Ortec,Inc., has increased the safety training staff.  Employees are routinely trained in chemical hazards and chemical release prevention methods.  Ortec, Inc. is also proactive in the area of process safety by conducting hazard analyses on all major processes even when not specifically required by law."
