              "Description": "Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) have been done on various parts of the Fluoroproducts processes for over 20 years. Safety information is reviewed and revised continuously depending on such factors as the PHA cycle, material hazards, safe limits, SDSs, P&IDs, etc. To spread the PHA workload over time, the Fluoroproducts processes have been divided into \"subsections\" with the separate PHAs in each of the subsections being updated on off-set 5-year cycles. Operating procedures are also broken down into subsections with review/upgrading/revising done on a minimum 3-year cycle. Additional revisions may occur prior to the 3-year formal review cycle as upgrades are identified. Training for operators is specifically designed for a given operator title. Employees involved in maintenance activities obtain skills training at Lee College and process specific skills training in the area. Maintenance procedures are established for the maintenance jobs that have some degree of uniqueness to the area. Equipment in the Hydrofluoric Acid and Sulfuric Acid areas is inspected on a set schedule for each individual piece of equipment. Management of Change (MOC) procedures, which encompass Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs), are used when a Change of Design (COD) have been implemented in the area regardless of the magnitude of change. To insure compliance, a 3-year audit cycle as required by OSHA 1910.119, is used. The various components of OSHA 1910.119 are audited and a set schedule with roughly one component audited every 3 months. ",

Like DuPont, Chemours continues to adhere to the philosophy that all safety, health, and environmental incidents can and must be prevented, but is also committed to quickly responding to incidents that may occur despite the best prevention efforts. Safety, health, and environmental protection are core values of Chemours to protect both employees and the community. All environmental releases are documented and reported as required by various governmental agencies (e.g., National Response Center, LEPC, TCEQ, Harris County). \n\n\n\nPSM PROGRAM\n\n\n\nChemours La Porte Plant is regulated and complies with OSHA's PSM Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 emphasizing the prevention of process related chemical incidents that may potentially affect plant personnel, neighboring facilities, the community, and the environment. Chemours implements 14 key elements of the PSM program at the La Porte site:\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n1.) Process technology (PT)\n\n2.) Process hazards analysis (PHA)\n\n3.) Operating procedures & safe working practices\n\n4.) Management of change - technology (MOC-T)\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n5.) Personnel training and performance\n\n6.) Contractor safety performance\n\n7.) Management of change - personnel (MOC-P)\n\n8.) Incident investigation and reporting\n\n9.) Emergency planning and response\n\n10.) Auditing\n\n\n\nFacilities\n\n11.) Quality assurance (QA)\n\n12.) Mechanical integrity (MI)\n\n13.) Pre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\n14.) Management of change - subtle \n\n\n\nThe site PSM program is applied to two categories of process activities:\n\n1.) Higher Hazard Processes (HHPs)- defined as any activity that manufactures, handles, stores, or uses hazardous substances that, when released or ignited, can result in death or irreversible human health effects, significant property or environmental damage, or off-site impacts due to acute toxicity, flammability, explosi"

Lower Hazard Operation (LHOs) - defined as any activity that exclusively manufactures, handles, stores, or uses any substance with low potential for death or irreversible human health effects, significant property or environmental damage, or off-site impacts due to toxicity, asphyxiation, or mechanical hazards including stored energy. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nChemours employees are trained to recognize potential hazards associated with handling hazardous substances, and in reporting potential and actual emergency incidents, and securing assistance. \n\n\n\nSite alarms (maintained by the site landlord - DuPont) and plant communications are used to notify site occupants of an emergency event e.g., fire or fume release. A site Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of employees of Chemours, DuPont, Invista, and Kuraray make us the site ERT. The site ERT Team is on duty 24/7. NOTE: DuPont is the site landlord, and Chemours, Invista, and Kuraray are site tenants.   \n\n\n\nTypically, a plant alarm triggers these actions:\n\n- Mobilization of the ERT and equipment\n\n- Establishment of Incident Command (IC)\n\n- Assessment of the incident\n\n- Summon additional resources as needed (CIMA)\n\n- Personnel accounting\n\n- Modeling to determine onsite and offsite impact\n\n- Plant communications\n\n- LEPC notification\n\n- Other agency reporting as required\n\n\n\nSECURITY\n\n\n\nOverall site security is provided by DuPont (the site landlord) and complies with MTSA requirements. The site is not open to the public, and a high level of security is maintained at all times. Onsite and perimeter patrols are conducted frequently, and numerous security cameras are in place. Onsite accounting is maintained for all personnel onsite - employees, contractors, vendors, delivery personnel, and visitors. Vehicular access is tightly controlled - all inbound and outbound vehicles are inspected. \n\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO - OLEUM\n\n\n\nThe r"
