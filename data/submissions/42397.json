Equipment and maintenance records are kept on the site.\n\nBuffalo Coal uses third party contractors to transport the anhydrous ammonia and consultants to provide additional training in safety and emergency procedures for their employees.  The anhydrous ammonia tanks are owned and maintained by LaRoche Industries..\n\nBuffalo Coal coordinates its emergency procedures with the local LEPC and other industry in the area.\n\n1.2 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThere are three stationary sources and processes covered in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nProcess 1 - 12,000 gallon capacity anhydrous ammonia AST\nProcess 2 - 8,000 gallon capacity anhydrous ammonia AST\nProcess 3 - 12,000 gallon capacity anhydrous ammonia AST\n\n1.3 Worst Case and Alternative Scenarios Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit Discharge Distances\n\nBuffalo Coal performed a hazard assessment of its operations and concluded the worst case scenario release of anhydrous ammonia would result from the catastrophic failure of a storage tank that was filled to 85% of capacity.\n\nBuffalo Coal performed a hazard assessment of its operations and concluded that the alternative release scenario of anhydrous ammonia would most likely result from the failure of a transfer hose during the transfer of the material from a bulk tanker truck to a storage tank.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, Buffalo"

      "SummaryText": " Coal's passive mitigation systems such as the mass flow valves within the tank and active mitigation measures initiated by employees monitoring the material transfer will limit the duration and amount of material released below the capacity of both the tanker truck and storage tank.\n\n1.4 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe storage tanks are equipped with passive mitigation devices.  Mass flow valves are designed to prevent the rapid loss of material through piping as the result of a sudden loss of pressure.  Transfer operations moving anhydrous ammonia from tanker trucks to storage tanks are monitored by trained personnel.\n\nEmployees are trained as to the proper handling and hazards of anhydrous ammonia.  Containers are properly labeled and hazard warnings posted.  Personal protective equipment appropriate for working with anhydrous ammonia is provided to the employees.\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\nNone\n\n1.6 Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia, Buffalo Coal employees are trained to take immediate actions to mitigate the release, don personal protective equipment, evacuate to a designated area, communicate with other off-site personnel and contact local authorities through the LEPC.\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety"
