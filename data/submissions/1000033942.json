Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during day to day operation and during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Columbia River Processing to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\n  \n\nSafety at the Columbia River Processing facility is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  The design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices and the safe handling policies and procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nColumbia River Processing has a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan developed in compliance with the provisions of OAR 1910.38.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning as well as emergency response guidelines and a process for coordinating an emergency response with outside agencies.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n \n\n1.20   Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\n\n\nColumbia River Processing manufactures, processes, stores, and distributes cheese.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of both raw ingredients and the finished product.  This refrigeration process uses ammoni"

There is also a cheese starter system that requires up to 2,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.30   Worst-case release scenario and  alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView V (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n1.40   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nColumbia River Processing complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility is in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.\n\n \n\nColumbia River Processing's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency planning, and compliance audits.  This plan is reviewed annually an"

The plan is administered by the Tillamook County Creamery Association Director of Environmental and Political Affairs.\n\n \n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures and specific safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel are authorized to operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.
