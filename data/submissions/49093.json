      "SummaryText": "rategy has been to integrate the management practices associated with these 6 codes into our health, safety and environmental management policy and principles as well as our global policy requirements.  Continuous improvement has been driven by annual self-evaluation of the codes.\n\n\n\nA new Responsible Care was rolled out by the American Chemistry Council in 2001, which responds to both public feedback about the initiative and the changing global economic and socio-political climate.  The new Responsible Care initiative has resulted in a Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) technical specification, which all member companies must implement and then seek external certification to verify implementation.  Furthermore, an additional Code of Management Practice was added to address chemical security.  As required by the Responsible Care initiative, all affected sites have completed security vulnerability assessments.  As a result of these assessments, action plans were developed to address critical items identified.  \n\n\n\nLilly takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n\n\n1. Process safety information\n\n2. Process hazard analysis\n\n3. Operating procedures\n\n4. Training\n\n5. Mechanical integrity\n\n6. Management of change\n\n7. Pre-startup review\n\n8. Compliance audits\n\n9. Incident investigation\n\n10. Employee participation\n\n11. Hot work permit\n\n12. Contractors\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.
