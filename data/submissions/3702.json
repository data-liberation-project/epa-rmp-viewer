Our KEEP management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through KEEP.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Pekin Terminal is one of several facilities operated by Koch Nitrogen Company (Koch) supplying ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used as fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Pekin Terminal.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  At the terminal we receive anhydrous ammonia from barges as well as railcar.  We store anhydrous ammonia at the terminal until it is loaded on rail cars and trucks for distribution.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the terminal, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident his"

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals would be the loss of all of the ammonia in our largest vessel within 10 minutes.  In the case of the Pekin Terminal, this would involve our 30,000 ton refrigerated ammonia storage tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that ammonia vapors could travel, in this hypothetical case, would be greater than 25 miles from our facility.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, and others) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  The alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario that could involve an offsite exposure to ammonia vapors, is calculated to reach 5.8 miles from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario.  Once again, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this alternative release scenario.  We selected the alternative release scenario based on a release of liquid ammonia during barge unloading due to separation of the barge from the unloading hose caused by rough water conditions on the river.  We have several active mitigation measures in place to prevent the occurrence of this incident.  These active mitigation measures include the following:  1) Koch personnel and barge company personnel are present at the barge unloading cell throughout the unloading operation to monitor and control the unloading operations; 2) Koch personnel and barge company personnel present at the barge unloadin"

The presence of these active mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.\n\nWe have discussed these potential ammonia releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Tazwell County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Pekin Terminal has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1992.  We conduct ongoing analyses of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and place constant emphasis on safety.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n7 We provided an interlock system, which will shutdown ammonia loading pumps upon high pressure during product movement, in order to prevent release of ammonia due to over pressurization.\n7 We provided emergency shutdown switches at various locations within the facility in order to shutdown the terminal during emergencies.\n7 We routed all the relief valves with the exception of relief valves on the hot bullet back to the cryogenic tank. \n7 We switched to natural gas heating from propane heating for heating the cold ammonia from cryogenic tank prior to truck and rail car loading so that storage of propane is avoided at the terminal.\n \nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have contributed to our s"

On November 10, 1998, we encountered very high winds at the facility in excess of 60 mph.  The wind blew insulation off the large cryo tank and damaged the transformer causing a power failure.  Insulation continued to blow off the tank during the day and at 1:30 a large piece of insulation dislodged the shield protecting the 8\" relief valve on the cryo tank and damaged that relief valve.  At that time ammonia vapor began releasing from the valve.  The release continued for three hours until the wind dissipated and employees could get on top of the tank and isolate the relief valve.  There was a precautionary evacuation of approximately 100 homes to the north of the facility although the ammonia vapor was dissipating very quickly due to the high winds.  The interstate and railroad were also closed during the release.  There were no injuries or deaths as a result of this incident nor was there any environmental damage.  The accident was unavoidable due to the weather conditions at the time and beyond the control of the facility employees.  The Pekin Terminal employees followed proper emergency response procedures to ensure that onsite and offsite impacts were minimized.\n \n \nEmergency Response Program\n \nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Pekin Terminal with the Creve Coeur Volunteer Fire Department, the Creve Coeur Police Department, and the Tazwell County Sheriff.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Pekin Hospital, the Illinois State Patrol, the Central Illinois Power Company, the Central Illinois Gas Company, and the U.S. Coast Guard.
