Kensico is one of the locations where some of the City's water is treated with chlorine.\r\nNYCDEP is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \r\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately notify the DEP Police Eastview Precinct to mobilize DEP's emergency response team to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through county emergency management agencies.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\r\nNYCDEP is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, an individual, designated as the RMP Responsible Manager, has assumed overall responsibility for the implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP Responsible Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\r\nTo ensure that an offsite release scenario does not occur, the NYCDEP maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine. \r\n The multifaceted program includes the use of:\r\n\t- Chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n        - Personal chlorine monitors to continuously monitor concentrations in the employee's breathing zone;\r\n\t- Process Safety Information to document the safe process design;\r\n\t- Process Hazards Analyses to evaluate the chemical and pr"
