This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that\r\ncovers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nWe have 4 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Dimethyl Ether, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] and Propane. Dimethyl Ether is used for an aerosol propellant. Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for an aerosol propellant. Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements\r\nset out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-\r\n58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention\r\nprogram that is in place at our stationary source.\r\nProcess Safety Information Chem-Pak, Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP. The\r\nstudies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations\r\nand are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily\r\naccessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\nTraining\r\nChem-Pak, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\r\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\r\nRefresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nChem-Pak, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure\r\nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Chem-Pak, Inc. to manage changes in process\r\nchemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 11/22/2013. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other\r\nemployee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications"
