The unit will be designed so as to clean the air in the entire facility based on the cubic feet of air\r\nin the facility.  The unit will be automatically triggered into action when a leak is detected.  When the air is\r\nclean in the facility, an All Clear signal will alarm.\r\n\r\nThe program, as designed, will contain any leak that may occur, warn personnel of the leak, shut off the\r\ncylinder valves, and clean the air through filters so that no chlorine gas may escape outside of the\r\ncontained area.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years that have caused onsite or offsite\r\npersonal injury or property damage, and offsite environmental damage, evaluation, or in-place sheltering.\r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Services\r\n\r\nTo develop a worst-case scenario to the release of toxic substances like chlorine deciding the maximum\r\namount of substance that could be released is necessary and at what rate of release.

The\r\nRegulations predict that the release rates for the chemical is approximately 2,500 pounds per minute to\r\nchlorine.

The Regulations in part, require owners of Water Treatment Plants using toxic\r\nsubstances, to take efforts to prevent and/or reduce accidental releases of those substances, and to\r\ndocument those efforts in a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  This summary highlights the main points of\r\nthe City of Cullman Water Treatment Plant RMP.\r\n\r\nThe Utilities Board of the City of Cullman, Cullman, Alabama, Water Divisions operates and maintains a\r\nwater treatment facility located on Highway 278.  At present, the plant can and does, on occasion,\r\nproduce up to 24 million gallons/day (MGD).  The plant currently serves approximately 90,000 people.\r\n\r\nCullman accomplishes disinfection of the water through the addition of chlorine.  Chlorine is the only\r\nregulated substances used at the Cullman WTP.  Cullman stores the chlorine at the WTP in one-ton\r\ncontainers.\r\n\r\nThe threshold amount for chlorine is 2,500.  The facility either stores or has in use at times up to 10-14\r\none-ton cylinders or 20,000 to 28,000 pounds of chlorine on hand.  It was determined that there is no\r\ntransportation of chlorine or manufacturing of a regulated substance in the plant operation.  Therefore, the\r\nthreshold amount is exceeded.\r\n\r\nPlant Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCullman has successfully operated their chlorine equipment to disinfect water for many years.  As\r\npart of the management program, certain items of construction have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nAll chlorine cylinders, whether in operation or storage, are contained in an airtight structure.  The airtight\r\nstructure is designed so that the loading of new or full cylinders will be passed directly to the"
