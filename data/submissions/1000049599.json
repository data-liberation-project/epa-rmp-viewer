However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Lewis Run gas processing plant is located approximately 0.5 miles north of Lewis Run, PA on U.S. Highway 219.  The plant processes about 3 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed.  This produces a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are recovered are sold as a specification propane and a butane/natural gasoline mix product.  Total liquid production is approximately 238 BPD with total storage capacity of 1,821 Bbls.  The plant has inlet compression, dehydration, and utilizes a straight refrigeration process for hydrocarbon recovery.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane and butane.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\n\nThe facility was designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements fo the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of the facility.  The facility also operates under the auspices of the Pennsylvania DEP which requires practices and procedures to control emissions.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific steps include:\n\n1.  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms;\n\n2.  Process safety relief valves;\n\n3.  Automated plant shutdown system.  The plant will automat"

Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe Lewis Run gas plant was placed in operation in November 1997.  The plant has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site and no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Lewis Run gas plant Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the McKean County LEPC.  The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned.  However, safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
