The facility is located in Galena Park, TX and stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel occupying 196 acres with above ground storage tanks and two pressure vessels.  The pressure vessels accommodate the handling of 1,3-Butadiene to receive and deliver Butadiene by pipeline, tankcar, barge and ship.  The 1,3-Butadiene tanks are refrigerated for product quality reasons. This is the only regulated process governed by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation, meeting the NFPA 4 flammability requirements governing RMP.  The facility is required to comply with the PSM and RMP regulations because greater than 10,000 lbs of butadiene is stored onsite.  \n\nThe butadiene system includes two pressure vessels, chillers, exchangers, a flare, and associated piping.  The vessels and associated piping and equipment may contain over 17,706,277 lbs of butadiene.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Galena Park Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the companyA?s policy to notify the Galena Park LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\n\nAs discussed in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the EPA has defined the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that resul"

This WCS assumes the entire quantity contained in the largest vessel or section of piping within the butadiene system releases to the atmosphere, forms a vapor cloud, and is subsequently detonated.  One (1) pound per square inch overpressure is used as the endpoint as this is the threshold for potentially serious injuries to people from flying glass, falling debris, and other explosion effects.  \n\nAt Galena Park the largest quantity of the covered flammable substance, butadiene, is the largest of the butadiene tanks, T-201-340.  The WCS assumes this vessel in its entirety is released catastrophically to the atmosphere and the vapor cloud formed is ignited and then at some distance from the center of the explosion reaches an endpoint of one (1) PSI overpressure.  A total of 8,834,640 lbs is the maximum amount of butadiene that is stored tank in T-201-340 tanking into account an administrative control limiting the maximum level of butadiene in the tank to 83 feet and 4 inches.  Using RMP*Comp to calculate the distance to endpoint, a 1.60 mile radius is estimated to be impacted if the worst case type of release occurred at Galena Park.  \n\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO DESPRICTION\n\nThe Galena Park Terminal's alternative release scenario is the total failure of a 10A? pipeline flange gasket within the butadiene system.  In this scenario, the failed gasket would be the source of a release of butadiene estimated to be 480,000 pounds within a 4 hour time frame.  Then calculated as a BLEVE condition using RMP*Comp; the radius of exposure for a 1 psi overpressure is 0.7 miles from the center of the release.  This scenario was used due to the fact that a flange gasket has a higher probability of failure than other pieces of equipment, although a total failure is highly unlikely due to the maintenance and operational procedures and checks that are in p"

The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidental release from the butadiene process at the Galena Park terminal.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo changes are currently planned to the butadiene process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the new butane process arise at the Galena Park Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Terminal Holdings, L.P.\n"
