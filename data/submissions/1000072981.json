In this capacity, Coyne is a re-seller of chemicals to industrial, commercial and municipal customers.  Of the current inventory consisting of approximately 200 types of chemicals, three are considered extraordinarily hazardous under the RMP regulations and are stored above the applicable threshold value.  The facility is located on 8.393 acres within the Edgely Industrial Park and is bordered by a rail siding to the North, a water retention basin on the East, State Road to the South and Westrock to the West.\n\n\n\nThe three chemicals on site subject to RMP regulations are:\n\n\n\nChlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5)\n\nSulfur Dioxide (CAS # 7746-09-5)\n\nOleum - 20% (CAS # 8014-95-7)\n\n\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are also subject to the OSHA PSM regulations (29 CFR 1910.119)\n\n\n\nStationary Source Identification\n\n\n\nCoyne Chemical has identified the storage of the reference materials as the only stationary source at the facility.  \n\n\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are both contained within pre-packaged cylinders containing 150 lbs. of product each.  All full cylinders are stored inside dedicated storage rooms within the warehouse in storage racks with 16 cylinders per rack. The worst-case release scenario at the facility is a full cylinder release of a sulfur dioxide cylinder occurring outside of the facility during the unloading process. This scenario does not take into account any of the passive mitigating systems built into the storage process.   Due to the fact that that the sulfur dioxide and chlorine cylinders are stored in storage racks designed to house this type of cylinder and transported in the storage racks or individually secured within the transportation vehicle, and the loading and unloading step is the shortest step of the process, the worst-case scenario is not likely to occur.\n\n\n\nOleum is transferred from ta"

These programs address the following items deemed critical to achieving this goal:\n\n\n\nA.    Documentation, review, coordination and tests of emergency response plans.\n\nB.    Procedures for response, reporting, investigation and implementation of preventative measures with respect to incidents which could have or did result in a release, explosion and/or fire.\n\nC.
