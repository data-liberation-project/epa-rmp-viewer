It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe Speer Plant is a natural gas liquid stabilization plant. Raw natural gas enters the plant by pipeline. Natural gas liquids are separated from the gas stream in the facility's inlet slug catcher. The finished product from the stabilization plant is stored onsite and loaded into trucks for local sale.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe Speer Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and many of the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Key elements of these programs include:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: Employees are consulted on the development of the required elements of the RMP Program. Employees participate by developing, revising, and auditing the RMP program where applicable.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: The Speer Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup after turnaround.\n\n\n\nTraining: The plant has imp"

Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\n\n\nContractors: Speer Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: The Speer Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine the causes of an incident or near miss and to develop actions to prevent recurrence of a similar incident.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP procedures and regulations.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenanc"

The computerized process control system has its own power backup.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nNo major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion, involving one or more regulated substances that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment. has occurred in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Speer Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Speer Plant is coordinated with the La Salle Fire Protection District. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Speer Plant has 24-hour communications capability"
