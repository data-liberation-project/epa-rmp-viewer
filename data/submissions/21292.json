If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n   -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed.\n\n   -The maximum quantity stored would be 140,200 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  The Worst-case and Alternative Release scenario\n\n   a.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,200 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 87 percent capacity as limited by desgn standards.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n   b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a relief valve.  The distance to endpoint. (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program \n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"SafetyRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,  K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Intsitute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that\n     -have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n     -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property    damage, or"

The emergency response program\n\n         Fertilizer Services Co.  has:\n\n     a.  an emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR1910.38\n\n     b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title (EPCRA)\n\n 7.   Planned changes to improve safety\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  We conduct yearly safety meetings, safety equipment checks, and check emergency spill equipment procedures.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time."
