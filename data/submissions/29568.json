Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Plainview Water Reclamation Plant, Plainview, Texas, are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant?s primary activities encompass wastewater treatment for the City of Plainview, Texas.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility, Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous).  These regulated substances at our facility are used to treat (disinfect) wastewater prior to discharge.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) is 8,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we used RMP*Comp (V1.07).  RMP*Comp is a free program used to perform the offsite consequence.  RMP*Comp was developed by the CAMEO Team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA.  For additional guidance, we used the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nChlorine:\n* Worst case release scenario:  Failure of one of the 2000-pound storage tanks would release 2000 pounds of chlorine in a liquid spill and vaporization over 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation considered.  At Class F atmospheric stabil"

No passive mitigation considered.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n* Alternative Scenario 2:  Vessel leak resulting in the release of 37 pounds per minute of chlorine in a gaseous form over 54 minutes.

At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n* Alternative Scenario 2:  Vessel leak resulting in the release of 18 pounds per minute of sulfur dioxide in a gaseous form over 60 minutes.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a Hazard Review Checklist for Chlorine and for Sulfur Dioxide.  The checklist is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Plainview Water Reclamation Plant maintains written operating procedures in the form of Operation and Maintenance Manuals.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
