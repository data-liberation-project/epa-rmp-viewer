During the PHAs, each system was methodically assessed and evaluated. Points in the system where ammonia could potentially be released were identified.  Valves that are relied upon to respond to an ammonia release were identified as shown on the system engineering diagrams. Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Analysis section of the Risk Management Program and are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Evergy maintains detailed written operating procedures. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of both ammonia storage systems are in place. The SOPs are posted in appropriate areas. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nPersonnel are trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nThe ammonia systems is visually inspected once per shift on a 24-hour per day basis. Plant security personnel inspect the areas in which the ammonia tanks are located on an hourly basis.  The Hawthorn Generating Station has established operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.

The likelihood of such an incident occurring is miniscule; anhydrous ammonia tanks are installed with multiple safety systems to prevent the release of an entire tank in a single event.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case. Engineered controls, such as automatic shut-off valves, check valves, relief valves and water misting system can be considered in the analysis.\n\nThe type of system failure identified for the alternative release was a loss of ammonia caused by a major leak in the liquid piping network between the tank and vaporizers. As a conservative estimate, the rate of release was assumed to be the maximum flow that would not cause the ammonia storage tank liquid excess flow valves to automatically shut. The leak was assumed to continue until the ammonia odor would alert an operator or plant security personnel. The main isolation valve would be closed manually if it is safe to do so. If the ammonia vapor concentration is unsafe for facility response, the Kansas City Fire Department will be called to respond to the emergency. The estimated time for leak detection and complete response for the Fire Department in the alternate release scenario is 60 minutes.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nEvergy has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nEvergy Hawthorn maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the ammonia processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR"

The facility is situated east of Interstate I-435 on the south bank of the Missouri River, west of the confluence of the Missouri and Blue Rivers. The property south and west of the Hawthorn Generating Station is urban and occupied by other industrial entities. The strip of property directly across the Missouri River from the Hawthorn Generating Station is generally not developed and wooded.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Hawthorn Generating Station as an air pollution control additive, to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to the atmosphere from the unit boilers. Each boiler unit is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nEvergy Hawthorn Generating Station maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds. Evergy stores the chemical in one (1) 8,000 gallon (39,000 pounds) tank and one (1) 30,000 gallon (145,000 pounds) tank. The storage and management of anhydrous ammonia for both systems is addressed in this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia was calculated as the loss of the larger 30,000-gallon tank in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development. The ammonia would be released as a gas. As required by the rule, only administrative control systems such as the company policy to fill the tanks to a maximum of 85% liquid by volume, were taken into consideration. The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those specified in the EPA Off-Site"
