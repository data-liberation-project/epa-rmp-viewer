The regulated substance on-site is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nC.\tThe general accidental release prevention program involves multiple levels of training, monitoring (both automated and custodial) and regular inspections of the refrigeration system components.\r\n\r\nD.\tWe have had no accidents at this facility over the previous 5 years. The facility has been in operation since October 20, 2004. \r\n\r\nE.\tThe emergency response program is available for review by our team members as well as contractors. The program is coordinated through the Allegan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The LEPC has developed the Off-Site Spill Response Plan for the facility. The facility is equipped with alert and notification systems. The employees are trained in how to properly evacuate the facility. There is no HAZMAT team in place at the facility. The local emergency response authorities will handle major releases. The program includes notification information, pre-emergency planning & coordination with outside parties, personnel roles, lines of authority, training, medical surveillance, communication, emergency recognition/prevention, incident report forms/process, safe distance information, site security/control, evacuation routes, fire/earthquake/tornado procedures, accounting procedures, decontamination instructions, ammonia response procedures, and critique follow-up to incidents.\r\n\r\nF.\tThe planned changes we have to improve safety is to ensure that our management and team members continue to be trained in the area of prevention and response to accidental anhydrous ammonia releases."

      "SummaryText": "RMP Program Executive Summary\r\n\r\nPer section 68.155, Hudsonville Creamery & Ice Cream submits the following:\r\n\r\nHudsonville Creamery & Ice Cream Company is committed to safety regarding its anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. The company takes the safety of all affected parties seriously and attempts to mitigate potential hazards by training team members.\r\n\r\nInformation on Hudsonville Ice Cream and its use of Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nHudsonville Creamery & Ice Cream Company, LLC is a producer of ice cream for consumers. The facility is the workplace home for 45 full time team members. The facility is located at 345 East 48th street in Holland, Michigan. \r\n\r\nIce cream production and storage requires refrigeration. A very efficient and effective method to refrigerate this product is by the use of anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical in both its liquid and vapor states. Anhydrous ammonia is present at the facility in both liquid and vapor states. The ammonia is used to cool, freezer and store ice cream at the Hudsonville Ice Cream facility.\r\n\r\nA.\tThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\r\n\u00b7\tOur policy for accidental release prevention is that we have implemented what we believe to be an effective program to prevent accidental releases of ammonia into the atmosphere. Per OSHA's regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 we have had a full PSM program designed, developed and implemented to prevent ammonia releases. The facility also falls under EPA's RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68 due to the use of anhydrous ammonia. Our policy is that we are committed to following the elements of our accidental release prevention program through the planning, training and maintenance of our system.\r\n\u00b7\tOur emergency response policy is that we will respond as quickly as appropriate to minimize the impact an accident will have on the population surrounding our site as well as our team members.\r\n\r\nB.\tThe stationary s"
