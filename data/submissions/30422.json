This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe East Carlsbad Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant designed to process 25 MMCF per day through two process skids.  Approximately 18 MMSCF/D is processed through the cryogenic skid and the remainder goes through the QBJ Refrigeration unit. Operations are continuous 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  There is a minimum of one operator and one field operator present at all times.\n\nThe plant takes in, uses, and produces various streams.  The streams can be broken into broad categories of inputs, catalysts, chemicals, outputs, and waste streams.  Each of these categories may contain one or more materials.  The process also uses several utilities.\n\nThe East Carlsbad Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\nThe following is a"
