View Plant, Bakersfield, Ca 93307\n\nExecutive Summary for Ammonia Refrigeration Systems and Chlorine Gas Systems\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at Grimmway Enterprises, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility. It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage. We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility. Substance one is ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant. Substance two is chlorine gas which is used for water treatment in our plant\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario: To evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPAs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPAs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Our facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, op"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazop. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at regular intervals.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conduction activities within our covered processes, our facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial\n\nstartup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining: \n\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided every 3 years and more frequently as necessary.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nOur facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks of process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. The timing of their inspections follow the recommended guidelines available from the manufacturer, the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration and the Chlorine Institute. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identifies by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: \n\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in proc"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nOur facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Audits are conducted annually with a comprehensive triennial\n\naudit.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nOur facility promptly investigates any incidents that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the\n\nsituation leading into the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nOur Facility management truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
