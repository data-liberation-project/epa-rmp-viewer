      "SummaryText": "Caviness Beef Packers Hereford Plant is an existing beef cattle slaughtering and packing plant owned and operated by Caviness Beef Packers, Ltd. (Caviness), located approximately 5 miles southwest of Hereford, in Deaf Smith County, Texas. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia in an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing products throughout the plant, which is identified as the stationary source for the purposes of the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations at this facility. Recent expansion included additional refrigeration system equipment and an increase in ammonia inventory.\r\nThe plant has had no accidents related to the ammonia refrigeration system in the past 5 years. An accidental release prevention program and emergency response program are in place in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations. All existing OSHA PSM information is incorporated into this Risk Management Plan. Through these programs, the Caviness team prioritizes preventing accidental releases and is continuously looking for ways to improve safety of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\nThe prevention program at the plant includes regular inspections and preventative maintenance of all system components, along with operating procedures for startup, normal operation, shutdown and emergency shutdown, inspection and maintenance schedules and identifies responsibilities of key personnel. Other safety features designed into the system include alarms and automatic shutdown devices used to identify and prevent unsafe conditions.\r\nThe emergency response program includes employee safety training, procedures for evacuation and notification for all types of emergencies, including accidental ammonia releases, and identifies response actions and responsibilities of key personnel. Employee safety training is conducted both during pre-employment orientation and annually thereafter. Evacuation drills at the plant are conducte"
