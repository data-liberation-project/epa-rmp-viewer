This vessel has safety relief valves to prevent the vessel from rupturing and from releasing large quantities of its contents in a short period of time. The facility also has ambient chlorine monitors in the area of this vessel.  These monitors would detect a chlorine release from the vessel, which would allow the facility's emergency action plan to be activated.  Local response agencies would be immediately notified of the release, the agencies would take actions to mitigate the impact of the release, and members of the public potentially impacted by the release would be notified. \n\nAlternative Scenario (More Probable)\nThe RMP rule also requires that at least one alternative (more probable) release scenario be evaluated for chlorine. The alternative scenario reflect a type of release that is more likely to occur compared to the worst-case scenario. Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as shut-off valves, and a more realistic release quantity and release rate.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input. Lastly, it assumes local, typical meteorology, which is more realistic than the conservative meteorological conditions that must be assumed for the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine that was chosen at Trentwood consisted of a release of chlorine through a broken pipeline, which resulted in offsite impacts. This scenario was chosen as the alternate release scenario because the release would occur in an area that would be more difficult to notice as compared to other areas, and therefore, may take longer to detect the release. The Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model was used again to estimate the distance to the toxic end point for chlorine for this scenario.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere have been ten (10) accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years; the largest release w"

Trentwood annually manufactures over 550 million pounds of aluminum for world-wide markets in the aerospace, ground transportation, general engineering and packaging (beverage can) industries. Trentwood has achieved and maintained numerous quality certifications including: ISO 9002, D1 9000 (Boeing's quality certification), AS 9000(the aerospace industry's quality certification), and QS 9000 (the automotive industry's quality certification).\n\nThe facility obtains molten aluminum from Kaiser's Mead reduction plant, recovered aluminum from a beverage can recycler, purchased aluminum ingot and sow, and internal scrap aluminum from the Trentwood Works facility.  The raw materials and alloys are melted and cast into aluminum rolling ingots. The molten metal is mixed with alloying metals and fluxed with chlorine to remove impurities to provide the aluminum alloy required by the final customer for the products they produce.  The various alloys are processed through various areas which may include, hot and cold rolling, heat treating, coating and other processes which ready the material for distribution to the end customer. \n\nKaiser Trentwood is committed to a zero injuries/illness approach to safety as described in the Kaiser Aluminum Corporation Safety and Health Policy issued by the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This policy states among other things that, \"All accidents, injuries, and occupational illnesses are preventable and the causes leading to them are manageable,\" and that, \"Assurance of a safe and healthy environment is everyone's responsibility.\" The Corporation has comprehensive written safety, health, and environmental programs and procedures.

The plan must also include mitigation measures to reduce the potential impact on the public in the unlikely event of a release. The requirements of the plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\nKaiser Trentwood is subjected to the RMP requirements because chlorine is stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.  There are 3 different RMP compliance programs. Because the facility is subject to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries Process Safety Management (PSM) regualtions (which is equivalent to being subject to the OSHA PSM program), the facility's chlorine distribution system process is subject to the most stringent of three RMP programs (Program 3).\n\nThe RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment. The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public. The hazard assessment includes a worst-case (low probability) and alternate release (more probable) scenario, and a 5-year history of accidental releases of chlorine. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serves as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore  referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a submittal to the"

This submittal includes an Executive Summary and is referred to as the RMP Submittal. \n\n\nHazard Assessment for RMP\nA Chlorine Distribution System Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the Hazard Assessment determined the distance a set endpoint concentration of chlorine gas would travel from the source. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The Hazard Assessment considered two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" (low probability) and an \"alternative\" (more probable) case. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario (Low Probability)\nThe worst-case scenario for the Kaiser Trentwood Works facility was the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel at the facility containing chlorine. The release of this vessel was assumed to occur in 10 minutes (as required by the RMP regulations). The Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model was used to estimate the distance to the toxic end point for chlorine for this scenario.  Under this scenario, the release had offsite impact on receptors.  \n\nThe regulations require that the development of a worst-case release scenario be based on conservative assumptions. For example, it is required to assume that the entire contents of the largest single container of chlorine will be released over 10 minutes without any active intervention from facility personnel or systems.  This worst-case scenario is unlikely to occur since the physical properties of chlorine are not consistent with the assumptions required by the regulation. \n\nIn other words, the regulation assumes the facility would do nothing in the event of a release and it does not consider the fact that the physical properties of chlorine are such that it would not allow the release to happen.\n\nThe largest single vessel at the Trentwood facility containing chlorine is d"

The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.  These 12 elements are summarized below.\n\nEmployee Participation\nKaiser supports and encourages employee participation in its safety program.  Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the employees and it allows the employee's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan. Employees are involved in the facility's hazard control program, incident investigation of near misses, as well as accident investigations, behavior observation safety (which is observation of safety aspects while a job is being performed), safety meetings, and employees participating in the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below.  Casting Department employees and contractors receive RMP/PSM awareness training that instructs them on how the RMP/PSM requirements may impact their jobs. Those employees who operate and maintain the RMP/PSM (chlorine) process are trained in how to safely maintain and operate these processes.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of a RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is supplied to contractors who work in the chlorine process area as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.

Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHA that was performed for the chlorine process.\n\nThe chlorine PHA was conducted in 1998 by an interdisciplinary team of Kaiser employees familiar with the process operation and maintenance, and plant management. The PHA was done using a combination of Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) and Checklist methods. Based on the results of the PHA, changes in operating and maintenance procedures, and other process safety management practices (i.e., evaluation of changes to process instrumentation, piping, and development of preventative maintenance programs) that would improve the overall safety of Kaiser's Trentwood facility were identified. The changes in operating procedure and training that most affect the severity and likelihood of a release have been adopted by the Trentwood Works facility and incorporated as part of the overall Process Safety Management Program. The other improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards will be implemented or incorporated into the overall Process Safety Management Program. \n\nOperating Procedures\nOperating procedures for the chlorine distribution system process have been developed as part of the RMP/PSM. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process.

Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine distribution process must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards, and safe work practices.\n\nKaiser Trentwood's employees have received initial training on the operations and maintenance of the regulated processes, an overview of each of the RMP/PSM plan elements, and the procedures that must be followed to comply with the requirements of the RMP/PSM plan. In addition to RMP/PSM plan training, Trentwood Works' employees have been trained to respond to an accidental release. Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years. Refresher training for emergency response is conducted annually.\n\nContractors\nKaiser Trentwood's facility must make contractors aware of the known hazards of the chlorine distribution system process related to the contractors' work.

No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that the facility is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely. \n\nTo initiate the pre-startup safety review, all updated elements of the Process Safety Management Plan are assembled for review. This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup checklist. The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign a Pre-Startup Safety Review Form.

Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including whether lockout/tagout or confined space entry provisions are applicable. The employees that carryout maintenance are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM.\n\nHot Works Permits\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the chlorine process. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program (Welding & Burning Permit Procedure) has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations.\n\nThe process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe workplace.
