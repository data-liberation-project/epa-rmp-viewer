As part of this commitment, the Fome Cor plant has established a prevention program to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. Similar safeguards apply to the pentane process and the difluoroethane process. Thus the prevention program applies to both processes with no exception. -PSM prevention program has been in place for 6 years and will include all RMP requirements. -All pressure relief valves are changed yearly. -Non destructive tests are performed yearly. -Visual check on tank farm is conducted approximately every 2 hours that the facility is operating. -Annual training is provided for all employees on PSM Overview. -Annual training for all involved employees on PSM Specific. -PSM/RMP Team meets frequently. -The facility is audited by Corporate every 3 years.",

As part of this commitment, the Fome-Cor plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a pentane and 1,1 difluoroethane (152A) Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68 and with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  The FomeCor facility has complied with the OSHA PSM standard since 1993.  \n\nPentane is stored on site in a 30,000 gallon tank.  152A is stored in a 5400 gallon tank.  \nPentane and 1,1 difluoroethane are mixed together to produce the foam.  The foam is then laminated with paper. This laminated foam is sold for use in the graphic arts industry and construction market.  \n\nIn order to minimize the potential for release, the facility has developed detailed procedures for handling pentane and 152 A.  The facility also proactively maintains the components of these systems by conducting nondestructive testing of the storage tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures are detected before they occur.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon pentane storage tank when filled to 85% resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint with a 1 psi over pressure will have offsite impact.  This explosion would impact local industries.  It would not impact any residential areas.  \n\nThe most realistic release scenario would involve a release from a hole in a pipe due to physical damage.  If this leak occurred at the discharge of the 152A transfer pump, approximately 7200 pounds of 152A could be released over a two hour period.  If this vapor cloud exploded, it would have offsite impact.  Similar to the wo"
