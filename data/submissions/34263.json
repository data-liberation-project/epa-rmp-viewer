This is accomplished through both engineering and administrative controls. All applicable elements of the U. S. EPA's Prevention Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management standard are adhered to. The Merisol Antioxidants LLC's Emergency Plan is tailored to meet the needs of any foreseeable release at the Oil City, PA facility, and was developed using input from the local emergency response agencies (Cornplanter Twp. Vol. FD, Rouseville Vol. FD, Oil City FD, and Venango County Emergency Management Agency). The plan was submitted and approved by the Venango County, PA Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Merisol Antioxidants LLC facility located at Oil City, PA is a manufacturing facility that produces Butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT), a crystalline Phenolic antioxidant. Isobutylene (2-methylpropene) is stored in bulk on the plant, and is used to add the butyl groups onto mixed cresols (methylphenol). The isobutylene storage tanks and associated transfer equipment have several engineered safety features, such as thick walled tanks; excess flow valves; perimeter monitor & alarm systems; pressure relief valves; a flare protected vent system; and administrative procedures to prevent or detect releases. The plant is manned 24 hours a day and the isobutylene system is monitored continuously. There are automated vapor dispersing, fire extinguishing, and associated alarm systems around the isobutylene storage and off-loading areas. All storage and handling equipment as well as all safety and countermeasure equipment are on a rigid test and inspection program as well as a general preventive maintenance program."

(29CFR1910.119)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of isobutylene within the last five years that meet the criteria of reporting in Air Programs, Part 68, Subpart B, 68.42. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMerisol Antioxidants LLC has a comprehensive emergency contingency program, which has been reviewed by the Venango county EMA and the local responding fire departments (Cornplanter Twp., Rouseville, and Oil City), and has been approved by the Venango County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). Merisol Antioxidants LLC does not have an emergency response team for fire response, but all operations and maintenance employees are trained at the 24-hour technician level for hazardous material spills and clean-up.

They have been trained how to assess the situation and communicate to emergency response personnel the most prudent course of action to take to safeguard the community. Merisol Antioxidants LLC management personnel will report to work on site with emergency responders as a resource for controlling releases of isobutylene, and for operating counter measure systems.  Merisol Antioxidants LLC personnel will assist the Incident Commander on the scene as specialists in handling isobutylene. The emergency plan is reviewed and resubmitted to the Venango County LEPC every year for its review and approval. Necessary elements of the plan are incorporated into the Venango County Emergency Response Plan.  Periodic tabletop or deployment drills are conducted to keep emergency response personnel familiar with plant materials, emergency systems, and response measures.\n\nRecent or Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMerisol Antioxidants LLC performs periodic process hazard analyses (safety reviews) of all chemical processes, including the isobutylene alkylation system. Some of the planned or recently completed changes to improve the safety of the isobutylene storage and transfer system are listed below.\n\n1) New bottoms were installed and inspections performed on the isobutylene storage vessels in 2003;\n2) External relief valves were installed on the isobutylene pumps to prevent over-pressure and over-temperature in 2003;\n3) New higher pressure rated piping and gaskets were installed in isobutylene liquid service piping associated with the storage vessels in 2003;\n4) The addition of excess flow valves for the vapor lines connecting the unloading area to the storage vessels are planned for 2004; and\n5) Reducing co-located volumes of isobutylene in railcars is planned for 2004.\n\n\n Merisol Antioxidants LLC has a continuous improvement philosophy in all safety and environment issues."
