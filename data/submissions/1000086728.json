Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nArctic Glacier is committed to maintaining a safe ice manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  \n\n\n\nOur RMP program includes elements addressing: \n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program. \n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards. \n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment. \n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring. \n\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. \n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits. \n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed prope"

(See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)\n\nThrough our RMP program, Arctic Glacier looks continuously for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility."
