Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nBlue Racer Midstream, LLC (Blue Racer) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training\n\nassociated with the processes at the facility. It is Blue Racer's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, Blue Racer has coordinated response activities with the Brook County EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.  \n\n\n\nB.    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Conley Station is a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) transfer and pumping station. It includes storage tanks and pumping equipment. LPG is received from the Natrium Plant via the G150 products pipeline, at a maximum nominal pressure of 240 psig. The material is pumped using two 10,200 gpm multi-stage pumps to a pressure of 1480 psig to be sent out via the G150 or Mariner East II (ME2) pipelines. The facility has three 30,000 gal storage tanks for trans mix LPG material and truck loading stations.  The LPGs are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nC.    The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\na.    Worst Case scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumes that the vessel with the largest amount of LPG (Mixed Butanes Storage Tank Tank V-950) had a catastrophic failure"

As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture, which in this case is butane. Meteorological conditions for worst-case scenarios are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h).\n\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved a release of 115,648 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.4 miles to the 1 psi endpoint.  \n\n\n\nb.    Alternative Case scenarios:\n\nTwo alternative-case scenarios were evaluated.  The first scenario was considered the potential loading hose (due to sudden uncoupling) failure from the loading area resulting in vapor cloud explosion. This scenario was considered more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  The internal diameter (ID) of the hose was estimated at 2 inches. The release rate of 3,190 lb/min for the selected chemical (propane) was calculated using RMPComp&trade;.   RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.2 miles to 1 psi overpressure endpoint resulting from a vapor cloud explosion with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77?F).\n\nThe second alternative scenario was a 1 inch hole or puncture on the vessel V 1950 resulting in vapor cloud fire. Since butane and propane have the same LFL (36 mg/L), butane, the selection of the chemical was based on the predominant regulated component of the mixture. Thus butane was the chemical used for this scenario.  RMP Comp &trade; was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77?F).
