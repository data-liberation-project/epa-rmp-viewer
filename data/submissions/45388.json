      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been updated to change the City of Donna Water Filtration Plant from a Prevention Program 2 to a Prevention Program 3. An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) auditor inspected the facility on January 31, 2006, and noted that the facility complied with Prevention Program 2 requirements but should be a Prevention Program 3, because Operations Management International, Inc., a private contractor, operates it. Employees of private contractors are subject to Federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulations, so the process is subject to Prevention Program 3. \n\nThe City of Donna Water Filtration Plant accidental release prevention policy integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices with a response plan that includes emergency services available in the community.  The facility prevention policy adheres to EPA  and OSHA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Donna Water Filtration Plant serves a population of approximately 14,800 and is located at 801 South Hutto Road, Donna, Hidalgo County, Texas, at north 26.160667 latitude and west -98.070027 longitude.\n\nOn the southeast side of the Plant, a three-walled canopy structure faces north and contains four, one-ton chlorine containers. Of the four, two containers are connected to the system at any given time.  One of the two containers is operational and the other is for backup.  Emergency air supply and power are available on-site.  The facility is staffed twelve hours a day and operators check the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located approximately 100 and 200 feet away from the chlorination building. \n\nThe City of Donna Water Filtration Plant handles chlorine in amounts exceeding the regulatory threshold set by the EPA and by OSHA for regulated substances and the f"

The EPA threshold quantity is 2,500 pounds; the OSHA threshold quantity is 1,500 pounds.  The facility is subject to Prevention Program 3 of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Water Filtration Plant includes consideration of two release scenarios for chlorine:\n1. A Worst-Case Release\n2. An Alternative Scenario\n\nThe following key elements outline the accidental release prevention program for the Donna Water Filtration Plant:\n\n$\tHigh level of training of the operators;\n$\tPreventive maintenance program;\n$\tUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment;\n$\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation   of the operators;\n$\tPerformance of a Process Hazard Analysis of equipment and procedures;\n$\tImplementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nAs part of its Prevention Program 3, the Donna Water Filtration Plant maintains an employee participation plan, Pre-startup Procedures, Hot Work Permit Procedures, Management of Change, and a procedure for contractors working at the facility, as well as an emergency plan and documents relating to operating procedures and employee training. \n\nPrevention steps include operator use of the available SCBA during connection/disconnection of the chemical supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chemical detector. Donna Water Treatment Plant management has an agreement with Chemical Response & Remediation Contractors, Inc. (CRRC) for assistance with emergency response.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Donna Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility=s Emergency Response Program.
