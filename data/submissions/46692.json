The\nteams are composed of a team leader, various personnel having knowledge of production and maintenance procedures,\nand a prodcution operator. Normally the HAZOP and What If / Checklist methods are used. The completion of\nrecommendations are tracted by an electronic data base. The Process and Quality (PQC) Manager is responsible\nfor implementation of this RMP element.\n\nThe Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) are written and updated by the process and production engineers / \nsupervisors. The Production Manager is responsible for keeping SOP's current. The SOP's are verified and certified for\ncorrectness once a year. The SOP's are available to relevant personnel via a LAN system and a \"hard copy\" of each\nSOP is available in the applicable production area.\n\nThe training is planned and tracted by the Safety and Training Manager according to the annual training plan.\nThe training materials include manuals, lesson plans, video tapes, overheads and field equipment. The understanding\nof the training is verrified by written tests, oral exams and demonstrations. Any one or all of these may be employed.\nThe training activities are tracked by a training database.\n\nThe Engineering Manager is responsible for implementation of the Mechanical Integrity Program.

Mitigation systems used are dikes, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains, hazmat foam system, fire fighting foam system, mineral oil dump systems, and nuetralization. Most of the process areas are monitored by leak detection and alarm systems for toxic and flammable gas leaks.  Operator refresher tranining is conducted on prescribed basis of the operator tranining program. The preventitive maintenance program conducts inspections and tests to assure operation of preventive devices.  Manangement of change procedures assures that all changes are reviwed for theior hazards before implementation. All incidents are investigated to determine root cause and corrective actions are implemented to prevent future incidents.\n\nThe site had no reportable accident during the last five years.\n\nThe site emergency response program meets the requirments of the EPA Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance.
