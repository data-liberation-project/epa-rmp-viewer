              "Description": "Ammonia Storage and Loading (6000)\nThe Prevention Program ensures that toxic and flammable substances are safely handled and that releases are detected and mitigated.  DGC applied the concepts of a successful on-site health and safety program to potential off-site consequences and protection of the public and environment.  The Prevention Program includes the procedures and programs in place to address the twelve elements of the Process Safety Management Prevention Standard.  This program integrates safety elements including design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Synfuels Plant.  The Synfuels Plant has complied with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\nThe main focus of the Prevention Program is reducing the likelihood of a release.  Procedures are in place to provide well-maintained equipment and well-trained staff and contractors along with design and process control systems to reduce the likelihood of a release.\n\nOne of the most important Prevention Program elements for ammonia handling areas is mechanical integrity.  The following elements are accomplished to prevent releases:\n\n- Peridoic walk-throughs in process areas to find vibrations, leaks, and potential failure points\n- Inspection, testing, and maintenance of process, storage, and pressure vessels on a routine schedule\n- Periodic replacement or preventive inspection and maintenance of pressure relief valves\n- Periodic inspection of process control instruments that have safety implications\n- Periodic inspection of major powered and rotating equipment for mechanical failure\n- Review of needed spare parts\n\nThe Synfuels Plant uses applicable codes, standards, and equipment history to establish an effective testing and inspection frequency.\n\nThe Synfuels Plant has a Quality Assurance Program to ensure the proper material of construction, fabrication, and inspection procedures are followed for new construction or management of change implementation.  Inspections, testing, and preventive maintenance of pressure vessels or piping systems are at established frequency based on industry standards or equipment history.  Inspection and testing of pressure relief valves are also at an established frequency.  The Synfuels Plant has established a covered process list for equipment, piping systems, electrical/instrumentation components, relief and vent systems, and fire protection systems.\n\nThe process hazards, process controls in use, mitigation systems in use, and monitoring/detection systems in use have been reviewed for each process area handling ammonia and are documented in the PHA and summarized in the RMP.\n\nA management system with overall responsibility for developing, implementing, and integrating the Risk Management Program requirements including the Prevention Program has been developed.\n\nDGC is committed to continually reduce risk, and programs are in place to manage the risks and provide continuous improvement.",

The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activities of the Synfuels Plant encompass the manufacture of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and other by-products from lignite coal using Lurgi gasification technology.  The SNG production rate is approximately 170 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  The Synfuels Plant also generates, sells, and ships a number of other products, including anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe substances present at the Synfuels Plant in quantities above applicable thresholds and regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP), Section 112(r), of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 are ammonia and flammable-gas mixtures containing various concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen.  The maximum inventories of Section 112(r) substances at the Synfuels Plant are approximately 65.6 million pounds of ammonia and approximately 150 thousand pounds of flammable-gas mixture.\n\nThe ammonia is used for sales as a fertilizer, in the refrigeration systems, and in the production of ammonium sulfate. The flammable gas mixtures are used in the manufacturing of SNG as well as the gas feed for the ammonia production facility.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe hazard assessment for the Synfuels Plant included computer analyses of potential releases from nine flammable-gas mixture process areas and three ammonia process areas to estimate the potential distance to explosion endpoints and toxic endpoints, respectively.  Two of the Synfuels Plant process areas include both flammable-gas mixtures and ammonia, for a total of ten process areas analyzed.  The impact analysis computer software refined modeling programs Degadis and SLAB, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP*Comp software, which employs equations "

The worst-case endpoints resulted in a pressure wave capable of shattering windows and causing possible related injuries.  The worst-case scenario considered for this process involves a flammable-gas mixture, namely methane.  The quantity released in the worst of the nine simulated scenarios was assumed to be 20,500 pounds from Gas Compression (1900), which classifies as a Program 1 process.  It was assumed that the entire quantity would be released as a vapor which finds an ignition source with a yield factor of ten percent of the available energy released in the vapor cloud explosion to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of one pound per square inch (PSI) overpressure is 0.22 miles.  The computer simulations predicted that explosions from flammable-gas mixtures would not occur off-site, resulting in no risk to the public from fire and explosion.\n\nThe development of potential impacts from ammonia handling areas, Ammonia Storage and Loading (6000), Ammonia Production (4400), and Ammonia Refrigeration in Rectisol (1400), included the computer simulation of potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the three Synfuels Plant ammonia handling areas.  The Section 112(r) toxic endpoint for ammonia is the ERPG-2 one-hour exposure limit of 200 parts per million.  An ERPG-2 value is the maximum concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe worst-case "

Passive mitigation controls involving a dike around a 60 million pound refrigerated storage tank were taken into account to calculate the worst-case impact from that source.  The mitigated release rate from the analysis of the refrigerated storage tank was estimated at 20,512 pounds per minute.  The diked area around the refrigerated tank was estimated to release approximately 1.23 million pounds over one hour, the toxic endpoint threshold exposure time.  As a result of accounting for the 200,708 square foot diked area around the large refrigerated storage tank, the simulated release from this 60 million pound tank was determined not to represent the worst-case impact.  The worst-case toxic endpoint distance was determined to occur with an ammonia release from a smaller pressurized tank.\n\nThe predicted worst-case impact was from the simulation of an unmitigated release of the entire contents of a one million gallon pressurized ammonia tank.  The release from the pressurized tank was required to be simulated as a ten-minute release of the entire contents, which resulted in a release rate of 545,540 pounds per minute and the total release of approximately 5.46 million pounds of ammonia.  The worst-case scenario was simulated at a required Class F atmospheric stability, or very stable, and a 1.5 meters per second wind speed.  Simulated worst-case ammonia releases were predicted, using the Degadis refined computer modeling program to have toxic endpoint impacts out to 4.5 miles from the plant site release point.  Such a catastrophic release is extremely unlikely if even possible.\n\nDGC was also required to perform a computer simulation of a more realistic alternative ammonia release since the worst-case ammonia impact extended off-site.  It is important to simulate the types of accidents which are more realistic and could potentially occur with off-site impacts.  A number of p"

The alternative scenario resulting in the maximum toxic endpoint distance involved the simulation of overpressurizing the same 1,000,000 gallon tank used in the worst-case analysis and the subsequent release of ammonia through pressure release valves.  The alternative scenario was simulated to occur at a continuous release rate of 2,045 pounds per minute with a total release of 122,700 pounds of ammonia over one hour.  The alternative release was simulated with an average site wind speed of 5.3 meters per second and a corresponding typical atmospheric stability of Class D, or neutral.  The predicted maximum distance using the SLAB computer program and the more realistic alternative release to the ammonia toxic endpoint was 1.5 miles.  The other alternative release scenario assessments resulted in only on-site or industrial site impacts and no residential receptors off-site.\n\n4.
