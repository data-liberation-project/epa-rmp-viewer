During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, H2Oinnovation has implemented a Job Hazard (JHA) program. The JHA is reviewed by the operator and signed to ensure that all hazards associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas are recognized prior to starting work."

The program is described in detail in the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which include facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.

The employees that work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\r\n\r\nH2Oinnovation management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and reference in the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP is located at 440 Fleitas Avenue, in Pass Christian, Harrison County, Mississippi.  The Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  The plant has an oxidation ditch process with aerobic digestion.  Average design flow is 7.0 MGD with a peak capacity of 9.0 MGD.  The facility has a gravity belt thickener for processing waste sludge prior to digestion and a belt filter press that dewaters the sludge to 15 - percent solids.  The dewatered sludge is transported to a land farm disposal site by subcontractor.   The Long Beach/Pass Christian plant was named Mississippi Plant of the Year in 1991 and received and O & M Excellence Award from the U.S. EPA in 1991 and 1996.\r\n\r\nThe Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.

Accordingly, H2Oinnovation has developed proactive safety and environment programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  H2Oinnovation has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, H2Oinnovation affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\r\n\r\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no release would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequence of a release should on occur.\r\n\r\nH2Oinnovbat"
