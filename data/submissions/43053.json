      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nEliokem Inc. has a chemical plant in Akron, Ohio, which is known as the Akron Plant.  The Akron Plant has been successfully manufacturing latex via polymerization since the 1940?s.  Our primary products include wet latex and resins.\n\nSince Eliokem Inc. use substances that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we have developed  a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Risk Management Plans are required when a Toxic or Flammable chemical is stored above the EPA threshold.  Under RMP, Eliokem Inc. created a scenario to estimate the potential impact on its community in the unlikely event of an accidental chemical release.  Eliokem, Inc. borders a recreational area. This is Joy Park located on Kelly Avenue. The distance to the park is greater then any of the estimated affected release areas.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nEliokem Inc.?s  Akron Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas and processes at our plant such as, design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.   Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we have coordinated response with the Akron Fire Department.  \n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Akron Plant has 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are 1,3-Butadiene and Acrylonitrile.  Both substances are used as raw materials for our latex products.\nThe maximum inventory of 1,3 Butadiene at our facility is 120,000 lbs. The flash point for 1,3-Butadiene is less then 0  F, with a boiling point of 25  F.\nAnd the maximum inventory of Acrylonitrile at our facility is 67,000 lbs. The flash point for Acrylonitrile is 32 F with a boiling point of 171.1 F. \n \nThe Worst Case Release S"

      "SummaryText": "cenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nPopulation effected by the release scenario was found by using Landview 5.0 which contained the most recent Census data from 2000. The maps used were also from Landview 5.0 and are based upon USGS information. The USGS database was also used to identify environmental receptors.\n\nWorst case and alternate scenarios have been established and demonstrate the nearby areas which will be affected.  The worst case release scenario submitted for flammable substances involves a catastrophic release of 1,3 Butadiene from its storage location.  This scenario involves the release of 120,000 lbs. of 1,3 Butadiene.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have been considered when evaluating this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10% of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. There is a higher chance of the material being released at a height of 3.5 feet then 0 feet. Therefore, the calculation are based upon 3.5 feet. Under the worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternate release scenario submitted for flammable substances involves a release of 1,3 Butadiene from its storage location.  The release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 30,240 lbs. of 1,3 Butadiene in 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.20 miles.\n\nBoth endpoint distances are measured from the point of the release.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for toxic substances involves a catastrophic release of Acrylonitrile from its storage location.  This scenario involves the release of 67,000 lbs. of Acrylonitrile.  Passive mitigation systems such as d"

      "SummaryText": "ikes have been considered when evaluating this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as liquid and vapor, and will last for 4320 minutes.  Under the worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles is obtained corresponding to toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L.   This value is defined as the ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guidleline-2).  This value is developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  It is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.  The temperature used under this scenario is considered to be released at the highest daily maximum temperature, based on data for previous three years. The spill pool depth is assumed to be greater then 1cm and the volatilization rate is calculated at the boiling point of the substance.\n\nThe alternate release scenario submitted for toxic substances involves a release of  Acrylonitrile from its storage location via a pipe or flange leak.  The scenario involves the release of 67,000 lbs. of Acrylonitrile in 2024 minutes.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.20 miles.  As stated above, the toxic endpoint corresponds to the ERPG-2 value of 0.076 mg/L.\n\nBoth endpoint distances are measured from the point of the release. \n\n \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe Akron Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The Akron Plant is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular time period.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Akron Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Akron Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity \nThe Akron Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure the proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, control and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
