We seek to continuously improve our knowledge of process technology and learn from hazardous events in similar industries.  Multiple layers of protection involving engineering controls, administrative controls, and management systems work together to reduce risk.  In addition, key components of our program include leveraging knowledge, maintaining strong operational discipline, reviewing metrics, measuring performance, auditing programs, and updating documents.\n\n\n\n2) Facility description and regulated substances handled: \n\n\n\nPlaquemine Methocel is situated inside of the Dow Louisiana Operations (LAO) Industrial Park (iPark) in Plaquemine, Louisiana.  The Dow LAO site is a global-scale petrochemical complex.  It has been in continuous operation since 1956.  Plaquemine Methocel recently became a standalone DuPont site in Block 45 of the larger LAO complex.  Prior to April 1st, 2019, the facility was owned and operated by The Dow Chemical Company.  For over 60 years, Dow referred to the facility as the Cellulose Plant.  Historically, Dow included the Cellulose Plant in the site-wide Risk Management Plan (RMP).  This RMP is the first standalone submission.\n\n\n\nMETHOCEL (trademark) is a tradename for Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC).  Our facility makes various grades of HPMC, which is a white powder with many uses.  It is a water-soluble ether made from cellulose (naturally abundant polymers such as wood pulp).  HPMC is used as an emulsifier, film former, protective colloid, stabilizer, suspending agent, or thickener in food and drug applications.  It also has industrial applications.  For example, HPMC is used to manufacture catalytic converters.  \n\n\n\nEPA RMP regulated substances used to manufa"

And, while METHOCEL (trademark) is not toxic or corrosive, is a combustible dust.  Accordingly, it has a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) as required by the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.  \n\n\n\nNote the various prevention program elements and steps below.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Maintain detailed records of safety information such as chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design for each covered process.  This includes SDSs for chemicals, equipment specification sheets, and reactive chemical information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Conduct comprehensive studies to ensure process hazards are identified and controlled at regular intervals (at least every three years) and when prompted by operational changes.  Methodologies used to conduct these analyses include What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, LOPA, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis.  Studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Covered processes are governed by written standard operating procedures (SOPs).  These SOPs address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  SOPs are regularly reviewed and periodically updated.  And, SOPs are readily accessible to personnel involved in process operations.\n\n\n\nTraining:  A comprehensive training program is in place to ensure personnel are competent.  New employees are provided classroom training and computer-based training.  And, all new employees receive on-the-job mentoring and field training.  Refresher training is provided periodically and a"

Near misses logs and audit findings may be used to develop training material.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Routine and periodic maintenance checks are performed to ensure proper operations and to minimize/prevent incidents resulting from mechanical failures or equipment breakdowns.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process instrumentation and controls and pumps.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC):  An electronic MOC tool is used to document and manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes.  The MOC process also helps ensure personnel are provided training to safety adapt or transition to modifications.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:  Conduct Pre-start up safety reviews related to new, modified, and established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  Conduct audits on a regular basis to verify the provisions and requirements of the RMP rule are complied with.  Audits on covered processes are carried out at least every three years.  Corrective actions are identified and tracked to completion.  Auditors also generate opportunities for improvement (OFIs).\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  Teams investigate incidents that have resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the causal factors.  Corrective actions to prevent recurrence are also identified.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Everyone has a seat at the table"

Employees, contractors, and visitors are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention and to recommend improvements. \n\nContractors:  Contractors conduct specialized maintenance, construction, and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, the contractor's safety performance is evaluated.  Contractors are informed of hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors must declare hazards they introduce.\n\n\n\n4) Five-year accident history:  None.\n\n\n\n5) Emergency response program: \n\n\n\nAn Immediate Response Leader (IRL) is assigned to each shift.  The IRL is an experienced, highly-trained operator with knowledge of the facility and process operation.  Operations personnel receive emergency response (ER), first aid, and CPR training.  A representative from each shift is on the site-wide ER team (ERT), which is comprised of full-time Dow LAO employees.  Other personnel from across the Dow-LAO site serve on the ERT.  Site ER activities are coordinated with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nThe site has a written emergency response plan to direct and guide personnel in the event of an accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes various aspects of ER, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, mitigation of releases, and post-incident decontamination.\n\n\n\n6) Planned changes to improve safety: \n\n\n\nPlaquemine Methocel is continuously evaluating historical and current site practices against DuPont Global Standards and industry best practices to improv"
