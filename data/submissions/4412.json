We have not had a release to the environment, and the largest single vessel of any of the substances we handle and store is a 55 gallon drum containing 600 pounds of material. In 1997, AWI invested over $500,000 in upgrading our sprinkler system and building to meet existing NFPA and building code requirements. We stress safe, efficient handling and train our employees regularly. We are in the process of preparing for our ISO 9000 certification, and we expect to have  that completed by the end of 1999. On June 7, 1999 we conducted a walk thru with the City of Houston Fire Department to ensure our local firefighters were familiar with the layout of AWI and the products we store.\nAWI is a member of the City of Houston LEPC, and we also belong to the International Warehouses Logistics Association (IWLA) and its Council of Chemical Logistics Providers (CCLP).\nAWI is committed to the safety of our employees, our community and our customers products. We will continue to stress the importance of safe operations."
