      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Plainview Water Reclamation Plant\n\nPlainview, Texas\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Plainview Water Reclamation Plant, Plainview, Texas, are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plants primary activities encompass wastewater treatment for the City of Plainview, Texas.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility, Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous).  These regulated substances at our facility are used to treat (disinfect) wastewater prior to discharge.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) is 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we used RMP*Comp (V1.07).  RMP*Comp is a free program used to perform the offsite consequence.  RMP*Comp was developed by the CAMEO Team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA.  For additional guidance, we used the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nChlorine:\n\n* Worst case release scenario:  Failure of one of the 2000-pound storage tanks would release 2000 pounds of chlorine in a liquid spill and vaporization over 10 minutes.  Released into an enclosed space, in direct contact"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n* Alternative Scenario:  Vessel leak resulting in the release of 10 pounds per minute of chlorine in a gaseous form over 60 minutes.  Released into an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous):\n\n* Worst case release scenario:  Failure of one of the 2000-pound storage tanks would release 2000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in a liquid spill and vaporization over 10 minutes.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that includes the management system, major hazards summary, MSDS data sheets, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions and codes and standard"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a Hazard Review Checklist for Chlorine and for Sulfur Dioxide.  The checklist is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Plainview Water Reclamation Plant maintains written operating procedures in the form of Operation and Maintenance Manuals.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Training includes both formal classroom training and one-on-one on the job training.  Formal classroom training is provided at short courses to comply with operator certification requirements.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems and controls.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and ti"

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nPlainview Water Reclamation Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  There has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\n\n6.
