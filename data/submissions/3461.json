Cincinnati, Ohio 45214\n\nThe Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nClub Chef, Inc. has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.\n\nThis facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is Club Chef, Inc. policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations regarding hazardous materials, particularly anhydrous ammonia.  We have implemented reasonable controls to prevent a foreseeable release of ammonia.\n\nIf an accidental release should occur, Club Chef, Inc. has trained personnel that will respond to control and contain the release.  We have also coordinated with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Cincinnati Fire Department through annual filing of Sara Title III.  The Emergency Response Plan has provisions to notify these agencies should an incident occur that may affect the public.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nClub Chef, Inc. is a food processing plant for fresh cut produce.  Our process requires us to maintain an average plant temperature of 34 to38 degrees Fahrenheit. Anhydrous ammonia is the refrigerant used to maintain these low temperatures.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is only used as a refrigerant.  Ammonia is the refrigerant of choice due to its low cost, efficiency and environmentally friendly make up.  The ammonia is housed within a closed loop system that removes heat from the interior of the facility at low temperatures and pressures.  Heat is then dispersed at high pressures and temperatures to the outside atmosphere.\n\nThe refrigeration system at Club Chef, Inc. contains 13,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The refrigeration operation is a closed system with no purp"

The toxic endpoint was determined by using the RMP Comp computer modeling program and the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration.  With a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour) and a Stability Class of  F in an urban topography the endpoint of the release was determined to be .5 miles from the receiver.  The plant is located in the West End of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The public receptors within a radius of .5 miles from the plant site include, schools, office buildings, churches, and a park. \n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nAlternate case scenarios for Club Chef, Inc. was reviewed by the refrigeration technician, the refrigeration contractor and the company's safety manager.  After discussing the operations of the refrigeration system we determined that a liquid pump seal failure at the re-circulator vessel would be the most probable cause of a leak.  A liquid pump seal failure would create a quarter inch orifice from which ammonia would escape at a rate of 88.9 pounds per minute.  At the systems pressures, it was determined that 889 pounds of ammonia would be released in a ten minute period.  Wind speeds of 3.0 m/sec and a stability class of D were used.  The toxic endpoint was determined to be.1 miles by using RMP Comp, ERPG-2 computer program.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years that caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage to our facility.  There has been no accidental release of ammonia in the past five years that have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nRelease prevention program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe accidental release program es"

Our program includes detection alarms, ventilation systems, trained technicians who perform routine equipment checks, and a trained Emergency Response Team.  The ERT has safety equipment readily accessible to respond to an accidental release.  The safety equipment includes air monitoring units (specifically for ammonia) personal protective equipment and self contained breathing apparatus.  The Hamilton County LEPC and Cincinnati Fire Department are aware that our facility houses anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of a catastrophic release of ammonia, plans with the Hamilton County LEPC and the Cincinnati Fire Department have been implemented for evacuation of any affected area.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nClub Chef, Inc. has an emergency response plan to deal with emergencies that occur on site.  We have our own Emergency Response Team to handle an ammonia release.  Everyone on the team has been trained at a minimum;  24 hour HAZMAT Technician level or 40 hour HAZMAT Incident Command level.  The Emergency Response Team is re-certified every year per OSHA regulations.  The team also conducts drills to maintain effectiveness.  We have coordinated with the Hamilton County LEPC and Cincinnati Fire Department through EPCRA and SARA Title III reporting requirements."
