ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nAlbemarle Corporation (Albemarle) has always acknowledged its responsibility to provide its employees with a safe working environment and to be a responsible corporate citizen to the surrounding community.  Albemarle strives to meet or exceed applicable EPA and OSHA rules and regulations.  As part of this commitment, Albemarle periodically evaluates the quality of its environmental and safety programs.\n\nAlbemarle applies risk management by using a multi-layered approach for protective systems.  Independent layers of protection minimize the risk of process incidents due to the unlikelihood of simultaneous failure of several layers.  The following is the order of the protection-layered system:\n\n     1.    Basic Process Control\n     2.    Engineered Shut Down Systems\n     3.    Active Release Protection (scrubber, sprinkler system)\n     4.    Passive Release Protection (dikes, barriers)\n     5.    Plant Emergency Response\n     6.    Response from Outside Authorities\n\nThe protective layer concept places initial reliance on the process operation itself followed as needed by various layers of protective systems.  These protective layers include engineered process shutdown systems, followed by release controlling systems. \nShould the inner layers of safety protection fail to prevent or sufficiently mitigate an incident's effect, either on-site or off-site, then emergency response protection layers may be necessary.  \n\nThe facility's accident prevention and emergency response procedures have been designed for successful risk management and is a blend of sound organizational practices that prevent or mitigate incidents including operating procedures, employee training, preventative maintenance, management of change, process hazard analysis, and any other human factor components.  \n\nAlbemarle has integrated its emergency response procedures with those of the South Haven Fire Department and the Van Buren County Emergency Managemen"

STATIONARY SOURCE INFORMATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe South Haven facility, owned and operated by Albemarle, is located at 1421 Kalamazoo Street, South Haven, Michigan (Van Buren County).  Employing approximately 120 staff, the South Haven facility manufactures specialty organic chemicals, most of which are sold in bulk form to the pharmaceutical industry. \n\nThe South Haven facility currently has three processes covered in the risk management program, all of which are program level 3.  The three covered processes contain three regulated substances, which Albemarle uses as raw materials in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.  The covered processes and their regulated substances are summarized below:\n\n      A?    Process #1: On-site storage and handling of compressed gas cylinders containing methyl chloride and hydrogen chloride.  The risk management program rule regulates these substances as toxics.  The maximum expected inventory of these materials is 12,000 and 14,000 pounds, respectively (These amounts are conservative potentials, it should be noted actual inventories are often less).  Process #1 is a RMP program level 3 process.\n\n      A?    Process #2: On-site storage and handling of isopropylamine, stored as a liquid in 55-gallon drums.  The risk management program rule regulates this substance as a flammable.  The maximum expected inventory of isopropylamine is 20,000 pounds.  Process #2 is a RMP program level 3 process.\n\n      A?    Process #3: On-site reactor process containing a mixture with isopropylamine in a concentration greater than 1%.  This mixture has a NFPA flammability hazard rating of 4;   therefore, the risk management program rule regulates this entire mixture as flammable.  The maximum expected reactor mixture is 18,910 pounds.  Process #3 is a RMP program level 3 pr"

WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nIn estimating the worst-case scenarios, EPA requires that the entire contents of the largest storage vessel  will be released without the aid of active mitigation systems and safe work practices.  This is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked.  In addition to the worst-case release scenario, alternate release scenarios are also included in the risk management plan.  Alternate release scenarios may consider any active or passive mitigation measures associated with the covered process.\n\nAlbemarle referred to the OCA guidance manual and U.S. EPA software (MARPLOT) to estimate the impacts of worst-case release and alternate release scenarios for the regulated substances.  The RMP rule requires that the following release scenarios be reported:\n\n      A?    Hydrogen chloride: Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\n      A?    Methyl chloride: Alternative release scenario only. Since methyl chloride and hydrogen chloride are in the same process and the worst-case release distance to endpoint for methyl chloride is within that for hydrogen chloride, a worst-case release scenario is not required to be reported for methyl chloride.\n\n      A?    Isopropylamine: Worst-case release scenario for both the storage and reactor process since they affect different public receptors and an alternative release scenario for either process.  Because they are level 3 flammable processes, an alternative flammable release scenario is required.  Only one alternative release scenario is required for all flammable processes.\n\nThe following paragraphs summarize the results of the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.\n\nHydrogen Chloride Worst-Case Scenario\n\nUsing EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, the distance to endpoint for a worst-case hydrogen chloride gas release without any mitigation is 1.1 miles.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe Emergency Action and Response Plan (ERP) provides specific procedures that shall be implemented when the emergency siren is activated due to a chemical release, spill, fire, explosion, or run-away reaction.  While the prevention of a site emergency is Albemarle's goal, Albemarle has ensured that employees have adequate training to enable them to respond appropriately in the event that a site emergency does occur.  \n\nPlanning for a site emergency is a continuous process, starting with prevention and including preparedness, and response.  Albemarle takes its civic responsibility seriously and tries diligently to comply with all requirements\n\nTo help maintain an effective ERP, Albemarle has established and seeks to maintain a productive working relationship with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  Also, Albemarle regularly trains employees and keeps several up-to-date copies of the ERP in areas accessible to all personnel.\n \n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAlbemarle believes in emphasizing environmental and safety training. Albemarle will continue to assess the environmental impact of each process and proposes to design, build, operate and maintain operations so they remain safe and acceptable to local communities and are protective of the environment.\n\n"
