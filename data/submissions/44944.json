      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn response to the requirements of Federal EPA, this Risk Managemenmt Plan has been developed for the Belews Creek Steam Station (BCSS) located in Belews Creek, NC.  BCSS is owned and operated by Duke Energy.\n\nPLANT AND PROCESS INFORMATION\n\nBCSS has installed a new anhydrous ammonia system as a component supporting selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of the plant's boiler emissions.  Ammonia vapor (in the presence of the SCR catalyst) reduces NOx compounds to nitrogen and water to reduce the total NOx effluent emitted from the plant.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is comprised of six storage tanks - 3 for each plant boiler unit.  Each tank has a water capacity of 60,000 gallons, along with feed pumps and vaporizing equipment.  Each of the six tanks will be administratively controlled such that their individual capacity will not exceed 48,000 gallons, for an aggregate site capacity of 289,000 gallons.  This total quantity of ammonia exceeds threshold quantities which invoke the requirements of the Risk Management regulations.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nBCSS has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by regulations, including an extremely unlikely worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release of one of the tanks assuming worst case meteorological conditions).  Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors could be affected.  \n\nA release represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the design of the system components and the prevention program that has been put in place.\n\nEPA chemical release reporting databases, EPA guidance documents, and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulation is so unlikely that it should not be used as a basis for emergency planning purposes.  A more realistic potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented below.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA \"credible\" alternative release was formulated in a"

It is important to note that, while BCSS has not actively prepared for responding to a release of this severity, it is still very unlikely to occur due to numerous design, operational, and emergency response safeguard features that are in place.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nBCSS is committed to public safety, employee safety, continued reliable operation, and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  A management system has been developed with clearly defined accountability and responsibility for the Risk Management Program.\n\nTo help ensure that any serious chemical releases do not occur, BCSS maintains a release prevention program which is focused on protecting the public and plant employees from hazads associated with an accident or release involving ammonia.  This multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\nAmmonia gas detection and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\nProcess instrumentation and interlocks which will shutdown the system and isolate ammonia supplies to the plant if process conditions (such as flow, temperature, and pressure) are not within their appropriate safe operating ranges;\n\nProcess safety information which documents the safe design of the process system;\n\nProcess hazards analysis to evaluate the chemical and process hazards and make recommendations for safety improvements;\n\nWritten operating procedures to ensure the system is operated safely;\n\nMaintenance, inspection, and testing of system components to ensure that they are safe for continued use;\n\nSafe work practices to ensure that employees working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely, and know the actions to be taken in an emergenc"

The accident history for this existing use was reviewed for comparative pruposes.  Within the past five years, BCSS has had no accidental releases that resulted in injuries or property damage.  The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never han any major chemical release that could have had adverse effects on the public.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nIn the event that an ammonia release does occur, BCSS has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the appropriate off-site agencies including the Emergency Planning agencies of Stokes, Rockingham, Forsyth, and Guilford Counties, as well as the Belews Creek Fire Department.  BCSS maintains a 24/7 emergency response team on-site with the appropriate number of members, training, and equipment to actively respond to and take action necessary to secure credible releases of ammonia that might occur.  Additionally, there are a number of emergency operations procedures in place which detail the appropriate emergency actions that would help mitigate the effects of releases.\n\nMAINTAINING A SAFE OPERATION\n\nDuke Energy's Belews Creek Steam Station will continually work to safely manage the hazards of the ammonia system to pr"
