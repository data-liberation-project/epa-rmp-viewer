      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border and is the largest distributor of treated drinking water in the United States, delivering an average of 1.5 billion gallons of water per day to a 5,200-sauare-mile service area.\r\n\r\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert A. Skinner Water Treatment Plant (Skinner Plant).\r\n\r\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWDSC  constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility in 2008 to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\r\n\r\nSkinner Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integ"

The CCHF, which is equipped with two chlorine vapor scrubbing systems, was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  \r\n\r\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the Chlorine System at the Skinner Plant.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.  The Skinner Plant has a good safety record of chlorine use.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\r\n\r\nThe Robert A.

The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\r\n\r\nThe Chlorine System at the Skinner Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to convert the chlorine to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment systems for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\r\n\r\nThe chlorine storage vessels are totally contained in the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility storage bays.\r\n\r\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.  Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\r\n\r\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.

The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility is continuously monitored in the control room by video cameras and chlorine leak detectors. Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\r\n\r\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.

Skinner Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Skinner Plant mechanical integrity program includes the following:\r\n\r\n- Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\r\n- Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\r\n- Training of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program procedures; safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions; and safe use and application of special equipment and/or unique tools.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \r\n\r\nSkinner Plant requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the covered process.  Skinner Plant uses a permitting and training program to ensure hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine.\r\n\r\nSkinner Plant provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows Skinner Plant staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal complian"

      "SummaryText": "ce audits are conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Skinner Plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the recommendations and implement appropriate enhancements to the prevention program.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nSkinner Plant investigates all incidents that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases from a covered process at the Skinner Plant within the past five-years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary\r\n\r\nSkinner Plant is a non-responding facility and, as such, does not have an emergency response plan.

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside County Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Skinner Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Skinner Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified, evaluated and resolved for the chlorine process as a result of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted prior to implementation of the new Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, a significant additional safety enhancement and risk reduction measure. Further changes were identified in June 2006 and September 2007, when the process hazard and seismic risk analyses were updated to include the new chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.  Additional recommendations were developed as part of the Five-Year Update PHA and Seismic Assessments, in 2011 and 2012, respectively.  These recommendations have also been evaluated and implemented, as required. The 2016 PHA Revalidation did not generate any new recommendations and the 2017 Seismic Assessment reissued a single recommendation, which was evaluated and closed as of February 2018."
