As part of this program, the plant's processes are periodically evaluated to analyze all of the potential hazards associated with each process, including the potential to release chemicals. \n\nThe Baltimore Plant has also developed Standard Operating Procedures governing all employees and contractors that work in the facility.  These procedures incorporate safety measures to prevent employee injury, equipment damage, and accidental releases.  Additional Safe Work Procedures have also been developed to address the hazards associated with specific work activities performed in the plant.  Safety committees, consisting of personnel from all plant disciplines, periodically evaluate the procedures and perform behavior-based safety observations to monitor implementation.\n\nFMC Baltimore understands that maintaining the plant's process equipment in good working order is essential for the prevention of accidental releases and has accordingly developed and implemented a preventive maintenance program.  This program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that process equipment, and their associated systems, are maintained in a safe operating condition.  Routine inspections are performed and equipment checklists are used to provide advanced notice of potential maintenance and repair needs.\n\nTo ensure that the control measures at the Baltimore Plant are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled compliance audits are performed.  In accordance with the PSM program and FMC's corporate requirements, comprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program audits are conducted by an outside team of experts every three years.

The release scenario assumed the loss of 180,000 pounds of chlorine through a toxic gas release occurring over 10 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint established for chlorine (0.0087 mg/l) is approximately 14.0 miles under this worst-case scenario.  Public receptors identified include residences, institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons), parks and recreational areas, and major commercial, office and industrial buildings. \n\nFlammable Worst-Case Scenario: Isobutylene in the MAC Process\nThe worst-case release scenario selected for the RMP-regulated flammable substances assumes the complete loss of the entire contents of the plant's isobutylene storage vessel with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The release scenario assumes that the vessel is filled to the maximum permissible level and contains approximately 210,000 pounds of isobutylene.  Administrative controls at the plant limit the maximum quantity of isobutylene in the vessel to this amount.

      "SummaryText": "FMC CORPORATION\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS GROUP\nBALTIMORE, MARYLAND\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nIn an effort to proactively inform the community of changes occurring at the facility, the FMC Corporation, Agricultural Products Group (APG) Baltimore Plant has prepared this revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for resubmission to the EPA.  This is the Baltimore Plant's second revision since the original submission date in June 1999.  The changes incorporated in this revision reflect the removal of a previously reported process and its associated chemical inventory.  The Baltimore Plant no longer manufactures trimethyl orthoacetate (TMOA) and as a result, the inventory of anhydrous hydrogen chloride (AHCl) stored onsite has decreased substantially.  This reduction in chemical inventory changes the plant's worst-case toxic release scenario reported previously.  This means that AHCl is no longer available onsite in sufficient quantity to represent the plant's worst-case scenario for the release of a toxic chemical, as defined in the EPA's guidelines.  The new scenario, involving chlorine, is presented in this revised RMP.\n\nThe FMC APG Baltimore Plant manufacturing facility is committed to protecting the safety and health of employees, contractors, customers, the surrounding community and the environment.  Furthermore, it is committed to conducting business in a manner that is compatible with the balanced environmental needs of the community in which it operates. This commitment requires compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, facilities that are designed and operated to high standards, and systematic identification and management of safety, health, and environmental risks. \n\nIn keeping with this commitment, the FMC APG Baltimore Plant has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify and eliminate potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, process incidents, and breaches of se"
