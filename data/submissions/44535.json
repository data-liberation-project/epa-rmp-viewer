      "SummaryText": "Facility Background and Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nAt the Panama City facility we handle propane only, which is recognized by the EPA as a regulated, flammable substance.  The properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in its handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel or Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.   \n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to wholesale customers.  Propane is received and/or distributed to customers by transport truck and is stored in horizontal tanks.  The facility is also equipped to load or off-load barges as needed.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to impr"

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting programs.  \n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, the site is also equipped with emergency shutdown systems that activate, via remote control, positive shutoff valves and other critical interlocks designed to shutdown affected equipment or isolate a problem once it is detected.  \n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.  In addition, the site complies with EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.  \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u00c2\u00bfs (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPanama City is considered a non-responding facility and as such it maintains an Emergency Response Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations.  Notification of any potentially affected neighbors would be done"

Should an actual incident occur, the EAP gives employees guidance on how to respond to and handle minor accidents and incidental fires and spills.  Larger emergencies require assistance from local emergency response organizations and on-site personnel are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.  \n\nThe plan is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and as stated above, employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise.  This facility\u00c2\u00bfs EAP and Emergency Response Plan are based upon the following guidelines and standards:\n\n1) NPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks:  Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How To Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n2) OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, \u00c2\u00bfEmergency Action Plans\u00c2\u00bf, 29CFR 1910.39, \u00c2\u00bfFire Prevention Plans\u00c2\u00bf, 29 CFR 1910.119, \u00c2\u00bfProcess Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\u00c2\u00bf and 29 CFR 1910.120, \u00c2\u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\u00c2\u00bf\n3) National Fire Protection Association Guidelines, NFPA 58, \u00c2\u00bfLiquified Petroleum Gas Code\u00c2\u00bf and NFPA 54, \u00c2\u00bfNational Fuel Gas Code\u00c2\u00bf.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSince the initial RMP submission the odorant injection system was upgraded in order to significantly reduce fugitive emissions and minor leaks, thereby reducing odor complaints.  A project is currently underway to install a back-up generator to provide emergency power for security purposes."
