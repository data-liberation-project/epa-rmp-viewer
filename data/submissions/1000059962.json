This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Gas Processing System.  Signal Hill Petroleum's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nPropane, butane, pentane methane, ethane, isobutane, hexane and isopentane are the regulated substances at Signal Hill Petroleum. These regulated substances are stored as a flammable mixture in storage bullets near the facility fence line. The maximum intended inventory for the facility is outlined in the Process Chemicals section of the attached RMPeSubmit pages. The Process Safety Information chapter of the compliance workbook also contains the inventory calculations for the system.  \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and processing of flammables has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Signal Hill Petroleum has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.  In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a flammable release:\n\n-There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n-The system undergoes scheduled main"

Specifically, the external events requirements were met with the following actions:\n\nDescription of the types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2.   \n\n- During the Process Hazard Analysis, a broad list of external events was considered by the Team.
