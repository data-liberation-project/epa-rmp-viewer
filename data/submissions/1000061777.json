The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.

The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the Kwik Trip, Inc (DC East and West Systems) building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n4.

This expansion involved the building of a second independent ammonia refrigeration system.  While this system is a second closed loop ammonia refrigeration system and completely independent of the original system, the two systems share the same roof line.  In some roof locations, these two systems' piping are in proximity that could allow both systems to fail simultaneously (roof collapse, air crash, major fire, etc).  For this reason, the new system was included with the 'old' system and not identified as a separate facility for the purposes of reporting.  Documentation of the equipment in the 'new' system was included as a Management of Change with the 'old' system.\n\n\n\nHistorical Notes:\n\n\n\n11/22/2017 - For the 2017 RMPlan resubmittal, several changes were made.  Among these were:\n\n\n\n1 - Previous submittal amount was only for DC West Plant and need to include charge for East plant\n\n2 - Previous offsite consequence analyses used mitigated releases.  This was determined to be inaccurate.  2017 used no mitigation.\n\n3 - 2017 Offsite consequence analysis valued inserted into RMPlan used DC West values based on results of OCA\n\n"
