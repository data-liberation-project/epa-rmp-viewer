Accordingly, Utility Partners has developed proactive safety and environment programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Utility Partners has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, Utility Partners affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\r\n\r\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of requlated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no release would occur.  Accoordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequence of a release should on occur.\r\n\r\nUtility Partners takes"

      "SummaryText": "an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well-informed reguarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP) and actively participated in comprehensive process hazard analyses.  The employees that work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\r\n\r\nUtility Partners management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and reference in the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP is located at 440 Fleitan Avenue, in Pass Christian, Harrison County, Mississippi.  The Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  The plant has an oxidation ditch process with aerobic digestion.  Average design flow is 7.0 MGD with a peak capacity of 9.0 MGD.  The facility has a gravity belt thickener for processing waste sludge prior to digestion and a belt filter press that dewateers the sludge to 18 - percent solids.  The dewatered sludge is transported to a landfarm disposal site bya subcontractor.   The Long Beach/Pass Christian plant was named Mississippi Plant of the Year in 1991 and received and O & M Excellence Award from the U.S. EPA in 1991 and 1996.\r\n\r\nThe Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of six containers (12,000 pounds) on site.  In addition, the"

      "SummaryText": "Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of five containers (10,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\r\n\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n* Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment.\r\n\r\n* Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of: the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health efects of failure of controls.\r\n\r\n* Opeating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.\r\n\r\n* Training for each Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP employee involved in operating the chlorine system.\r\n\r\n* Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment.\r\n\r\n* Management of change procedures to manage changes (other than \"replacements in kind\") to the chlorine system.\r\n\r\n* Pre-startup safety review for additions or significant modifications to the chlorine process, or any new regulated chemical process.\r\n\r\n* Compliance audits at least every three years form 1999 to evaluate Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP compliance.\r\n\r\n* Incident investigation, to be conducted and documented for each incident that r"

The program is described in detail in the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which include facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety isssues are held regularly at the Long Beach/Pass Christian WWTP.
