This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n     - Promulgation of the Federal RMP Program per 40 CFR 68.\n     - Adoption of the Federal RMP Program by the State of California per Title 19 of the         \n     California Code of Regulations.\n     - Compliance with the General Duty clause of Title III, Section 112(r), CAA.\n\n     Both federal and state RMP programs require preparation and submittal of the RMP\ndocument no later than June 21, 1999. The generally accepted approach to fulfilling the RMP\nrequirements is to have a documented risk management and prevention program which outlines all\nthe steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. Burney Forest \nProducts (BFP) has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP in advance of the federal and state\nmandated due dates in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to\nprotect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\n     Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 the following summary is given:\n\n          The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at BFP are\n          delineated in Sections 7.0 and 8.0.\n          The RMP applies to the cogeneration facility located at 35586-C Hwy 299E in\n          Burney, CA.\n          Substance: Anhydrous Ammonia\n          The worst case release scenario is the failure of the anhydrous ammonia tank. The\n          tank is surrounded by a containment berm capable of holding the entire contents of\n          the tank. In addition, the tank and metering area are equipped with a water deluge\n          system designed to mitigate a major portion of any tank related release. This scenario\n          results in a spill of appr"

The toxic endpoint occurs\n          at 3.73 miles and affects approximately 6120 individuals.\n          The alternative release scenario is the rupture of the main distribution pipe used to\n          transfer ammonia (gas) from the vaporizers to the steam mixing area inside the main\n          boiler building. Two release scenarios were evaluated: (1) pipe rupture outside, and\n          (2) pipe rupture inside. Loss of ammonia is limited to pipe contents due to safety\n          valves subsequent to the vaporizers and prior to the steam mixing section. This\n          scenario results in a spill of approximately 100 lbs. of ammonia. The toxic endpoint\n          occurs on-site and affects no off-site receptor locations.\n          The general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following\n          elements:\n     \n          - Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\n          - Proper operation of all system equipment.\n          - Internal operating policies with respect to ammonia tank capacity.\n          - Comprehensive personnel training.\n          - A written emergency response plan.\n          - A written hazardous materials management plan.\n          - Documented safety procedures for employees and contractors.\n          - Inclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMP.\n          - Use of site specific monitors and chemical specific mitigation systems to detect and\n          mitigate potential releases.\n\n          The facility has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia in the last five years.\n          In addition, the facility has never experienced an accidental release of ammonia since\n          the system was installed.\n          The facility ERP is delineated in Section 8.0 (Attachments 8-1 and 8-3).\n     Both the federal and state RMP regulations require that the emergency response plan portion\nof the RMP include a delineation of the actions to be taken to protect hum"
