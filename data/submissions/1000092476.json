This commitment is demonstrated by ESJD - Hammond's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  It is ESJD - Hammond's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such releases do occur, there are highly trained employees on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. The site is also coordinated with the Hammond Fire Department, who provides emergency response services.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (?68.155(b))\n\nThere is one (1) regulated substance present at this facility. This substance is ammonia (anhydrous). The highest expected inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility is 17,000 pounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes). \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (?68.155(c))\n\nThe facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nInformation related to the hazards of the ammonia refrigeration system installed at the facility has been compiled. Prior to conducting the initial and subsequent hazard analysis, the process safety information was reviewed and utilized in identifying and mitigating recognized hazards. The process safety information was also used in the development of the operating procedures.   \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \n\nComprehensive studies are conducted to ensure that hazards asso"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: \n\nOperating procedures are maintained at the facility. These procedures address the various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process. \n\n\n\nTraining: \n\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least once every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity: \n\nDocumented maintenance checks are conducted on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with current training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change: \n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and processes.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: \n\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: \n\nIncidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance are promptly investigated. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All incident reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: \n\nESJD - Hammond strongly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort. Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP regulation, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\n\n\nContractors: \n\nContractors are utilized to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
