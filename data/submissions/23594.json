The facility is an electric cogenerating station consisting of four 170-MW, combined-cycle, natural gas-fired turbines coupled to a single steam turbine for electricity generation and steam production.  A duct burner/Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system are associated with each of the gas turbines.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is a 29.7% solution of ammonia in water.\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at Reliant Energy Channelview is comprised of two storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the evaporator for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The tanks have a capacity of 30,000 gallons each.  The tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves, as well as temperature, pressure, and level indicators.  There are ammonia detectors located on each tank and on the ammonia transfer pump skid.\n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and employed in the RMP*Comp, Version 1.06 modeling system.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) considered the catastrophic rupture of one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, in which the entire contents of one tank is released wi"

      "SummaryText": "thin the secondary containment dike.  The secondary containment dike is large enough to contain the entire volume and limits the exposed surface area of a pool, which reduces the release rate.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed and atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), the resulting ammonia cloud could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  This worst-case impact distance extends offsite of the Reliant Energy facility but does not exceed beyond the property boundaries of the Equistar Chemical facility.  The WCS does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals), parks, or recreational areas.\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios (ARSs) were considered including releases due to a failed delivery hose, a failed pipe between the ammonia transfer pumps and an ammonia flow control unit (AFCU), a failed pipe between an AFCU and an evaporator, and a corrosion-caused hole in piping.  The release due to a failed delivery hose resulted in the farthest impact distance (0.1 miles) and is the ARS presented in this RMP.  The impact due to the ARS extends offsite of the Reliant Energy facility but does not exceed beyond the property boundaries of the Equistar Chemical facility. The ARS does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals), parks, or recreational areas.\n\nThere are two water monitors located near the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, which could serve as active mitigation to knock down an ammonia plume in the event of a release.  The effect of this mitigation measure was not included in the ARS analyses as conservative approach, since the water monitors would be manually activated.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nA five-year accident history is not applicable, since this is a new facility that has yet to commence operations.\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\nReliant Energy Channelview is covered by an accidental rel"

This is a new facility, and there are not any planned changes to the system at this time."
