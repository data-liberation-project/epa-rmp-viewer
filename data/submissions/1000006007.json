Being a food processing facility, UniSea has gone far and above requirements so that even a small release is dealt with quickly, before any contamination of our product can occur.\n\nWe have been in the OSHA VPP process since 1996 and have acheived both MERIT and STAR status.  We are covered by the OSHA PSM rule 20 CFR 1910.119 and have been using those required processes since 1992.\n\nThe chemical at our Dutch Harbor facility with the most concern is Ammonia.  That is in a closed loop system.  The ammonia is used soley as a refrigerant for the freezing of our seafood products.  We believe that both the worst case and alternative scenarios attached are highly unlikely, given the procedures that are in place and the way the processes are laid out.  We have detectors set in key areas, with detection limits at very low levels, computer or process logic controllers (PLC's) which are constantly monitoring the environment, along with trained response personnel and response equipment.  \n\nUniSea Dutch Harbor has had a significant release of ammonia in the last Five (5)years.  \n\nWe work closely with the local Department of Public Safety, State OSHA, Coast Guard and Federal OSHA, in program development and response capabilities.  We have been under PSM since its adoption and have performed Process Hazards Analysis (PHA's) for Ammonia.  \n\nOur emergency response program involves several groups of employees in Dutch Harbor.  From our Power House to our Security group, both of which operate 24 hours a day.  Emergency response plans are at both locations along with several others.  The plans are exercised on a regular basis, either through drills or actual responses or requests from outside sources.  \n\nWe have instituted a change in our management process known to us as (FOCUS), as part of that process every two weeks all managers must provide information to the exectutives as"
