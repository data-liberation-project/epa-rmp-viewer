      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Aurora, Colorado facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is operated by Acme Distribution, and located at 18101 E. Colfax Avenue, Aurora, (Adams County) Colorado. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products packaged in aerosol cans for The Scotts Company, LLC, which is headquartered in Marysville, Ohio. \r\n\r\nThe aerosol cans are manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son, and consist of consumer product brands Off and Raid.  Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in the aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends.  The maximum potential quantities of aerosol products containing these substances were conservatively based on the forecasted shipments for the facility for 2012.  The maximum product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum potential inventories of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process.  Although the actual amounts in the warehouse at any given time should be much lower, the estimated maximum potential amount of each substance is: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tButane:\t57,081 lbs\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutane:\t19,357 lbs\r\n\u00bf\tPropane: \t39,541 lbs\r\n\r\nA worst case scenario was performed using the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and provided software (RMP*Comp) for a vessel with the greatest amount of propellant mixture.  The maximum quantity of each substance in a single vessel is: 0.39 lbs butane, 0.13 lbs of isobutane, and 0.13 lbs of propane.  The software predicts that the maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this mixture will not extend beyond facility property.  The calculated radius of impact for the mixture is 37 feet.  Note that the RMP*eSubmit program requires that the quantity of each substance be rounded to the nearest pound (1 lbs), and that the im"

      "SummaryText": "pact radius be reported to two significant digits in miles (0.01 mi).  \r\n\r\nNo offsite receptors would be impacted under either scenario.  When not being handled for shipment, all aerosols are stored on pallets within a dedicated aerosol cage equipped with additional sprinkler protection.  There have been no prior accidents at the facility associated with this process.\r\n\r\nThis process is being incorporated into the facility's emergency response/contingency plan which is provided to and coordinated with the Aurora Fire Department and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and Adams County LEPC.  The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed, and employees are also provided emergency response training on an annual basis."
