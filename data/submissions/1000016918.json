The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0\tDescription of The GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies.

The GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant maintenance program includes:\n\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n3. inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n4.6\tCompliance Audits\n\nThe GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n4.7\tIncident Investigations\n\nThe GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\nIndustry standards are followed at The GBRA Western Canyon Water Treatment Plant to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.  The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute,"
