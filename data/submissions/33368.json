Amoco Road in Joliet (Channahon Township), Illinois.  The facility was purchased from BP Amoco Chemical Company by Flint Hills Resources, LP on May 28, 2004.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Flint Hills Resources, LP - Joliet Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES    \n\n\n\nVarious chemicals are processed at the facility to produce materials for polyester fibers, fiberglass gasoline tanks, paints, wire coatings, plastics, insecticides, and food additives.  The only RMP-regulated substance at the facility in excess of the threshold quantity is butane, which is the primary material used in the Maleic Anhydride (MAN) production process.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  If an incident were to occur, it would be investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent a recurrence or a similar incident from occurring.  There have been no accidental releases of butane within the past five years.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention efforts in place at the Joliet Facility.

Examples of employee participation range from compiling and updating technical information to participating as a member of a team that systematically analyzes new and modified processes for hazards.  Teams that represent a good cross-section of levels and areas of the facility are formed to revise and update safety standards and to investigate accidents and issue reports to all personnel.  Safety focus teams in each area promote individual responsibility for safe work behaviors.  Some individual employees write operating procedures and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) plans; others serve as compliance auditors for the facility; and still others serve as members of the facility's Fire and Emergency Response Team.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility maintains documents describing all process safety information for the MAN process in the MAN Unit control room.  These documents describe chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and treatments, and emergency response considerations are provided in material safety data sheets which are also located in the control room.  The process operators use modern instrumentation to assist them in controlling the process within the design ranges. \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes m"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place.\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized by OSHA as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  A HAZOP study of the entire process unit is completed every five years.\n\n\n\nThe HAZOP team's recommendations for improvement are forwarded to management for resolution.  All recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including such activities as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced process operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new process operators.  Each operator reviews all operating procedures annually.  The procedures are located in the unit control room for ready-reference by process operators.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to the written oper"

Basic operator training is available at the local junior college and consists of the essentials that process operators need to know about process equipment and controls, regardless of their work location.  Basic operating training is completed before an operator starts the training specific to the process unit.  Unit-specific training is self-paced and conducted in the unit with experienced process operators or foremen over a period of several months.  An operator must become qualified on each section of the unit by demonstrating a hands-on mastery of every section task before operating that section independently.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nContractors are utilized at the Joliet Facility for construction and maintenance activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  All contractors must complete the Three Rivers Manufacturing Council Safety Course for contractors before being allowed into the facility to work.  They must recertify in this course annually.  In addition, the Joliet Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of the contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility con"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are properly prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nWell-established practices and procedures are in place to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  The combination of these activities forms a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.  Detailed and rigorous safety standards control entry into work areas and confined spaces, specify procedures to follow for isolating energy sources by lockout/tagout and describe the permitting process for completing work in the facility.  There are separate procedures for cleaning and isolating all major pieces of equipment.  Safety standards and work procedures are reviewed annually by all personnel who use them.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility has a hot work permit program that details areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in process areas for all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc., except in designated free burn areas.  The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, process operating conditions, and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future HAZOP studies.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the Process Safety Management program is functioning properly, the Joliet Facility periodically conducts an audit.  A complete audit of the entire PSM program is conducted every three years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Joliet Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of an RMP-regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response"

      "SummaryText": " equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Joliet Facility is coordinated with the Will County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which involves local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments, industrial neighbors, and mutual aid with industry).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and local emergency response organizations.  Additionally, the facility provides occasional refresher training to local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Joliet Facility resolves all findings from HAZOP studies, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes have been or are being implemented:\n\n\n\n* Additional hydrocarbon release detectors/sensors\n\n* Identification of liquid butane lines in a diked area around the butane sphere\n\n* Development of firm guidelines or procedures to control the amount and location of material storage and vehicle activity around the butane sphere.\n\n"
