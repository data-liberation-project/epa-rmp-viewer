      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  DWP has been operating the Encino Chlorination Station (ECS) since 1956, which is a chlorination facility that stores and uses anhydrous chlorine for disinfection purposes.  DWP decided to make significant changes to the existing chlorination facility to further enhance the safety and offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release. The modified chlorination facility is now in operation. The modified Encino chlorination station chlorine handling process is also subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan, and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to update the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) when a significant change occurs at the facility.  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed  to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency. DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the Encino chlorination station (station prior to modification) in June 2004.  This RMP is the update of the June 2004 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substance"

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA\u00bfs Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The Encino chlorination station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Encino chlorination station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Encino Chlorination Station is located at 4500 Encino Avenue, Encino, California.  The station serves to chlorinate the inlet to the membrane filtration plant, the reservoir inlet pipeline, and, in case of an emergency, the reservoir outlet pipeline.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of the San Fernando Valley with potable water.  The modifi"

      "SummaryText": "ed station consists of a three complex building: the pump station, the chlorination station and the micro filtration plant. A maximum of nine one-ton chlorine containers are stored at the facility.  A maximum of six one-ton containers can be attached to the chlorine header for discharging chlorine at one time, three in the liquid phase and three in the gas phase.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Encino modified chlorination station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Encino modified facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nDuring normal operations, six chlorine one-ton containers are manifolded together in two banks of three containers to supply chlorine, while the other three are stored as spares.  Six one-ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in each container.  All six containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves of the one-ton containers.  The primary bank is connected to  the chlorine liquid header and the secondary bank is connected to the chlorine gas header.  The liquid chlorine passes from the containers to the evaporator where it is vaporized in a water bath.  Gas from the secondary bank of containers bypasses the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry, or when the evaporators shut down due to (1) a low water level, (2) temperature condition, or (3) power loss.  Space is allocated in the room for the storage of three additional on"

The liquid header line is equipped with pressure gauges and an expansion chamber to protect against excessive pressure.  The primary (liquid) bank provides all the chlorine to the station through the evaporators until it is depleted.  The gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.  This automatic system is achieved by setting the automatic switchover vacuum regulating valve leading from the primary bank evaporator to primary, and setting the automatic vacuum regulating valve leading from the secondary bank to standby.  Once the primary bank is depleted, the higher vacuum level acts on the diaphragm of the automatic switchover vacuum regulating in the secondary bank, thereby pulling that valve open to start feeding gas.\n\nThe gaseous chlorine from the evaporators or from the chlorine gas header proceeds to the five chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  Chlorine gas from the chlorinators is pulled by vacuum to either an injection vault or two cabinets, where a total of 10 chlorine injectors are located.  Six injectors are located in an underground vault constructed over the 72-in diameter reservoir outlet pipeline.  Two other injectors are located in the Encino reservoir shore feed injection cabinet.  The final two injectors are located on the wall within the membrane filtration building.  The injectors provide vacuum, which draws chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is then piped through diffusers into the reservoir inlet and outlet pipeline, the membrane filtration plant inlet or outlet piping, and the shore feed pipeline.\n\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system is installed at the station.

The station is equipped with uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in addition to a backup power generator.  Therefore, in case of the failure of regular power, the scrubber will be functional.\n\nChlorine leak detectors with probes are provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorine storage room, the chlorinator room and the chlorine scrubber room.  The detectors activate an alarm system which includes:  (1) flashing red lights over the entry door to the building, (2) an audible and flashing alarm within the chlorination building, and (3) an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\nProcess control is by a programmable controller, which determines the feed rate relative to the water flow rate.  There are flow meters transmitting flow signals to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.  An emergency generator will automatically start and supply power to the entire system.\n\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms, which may occur.

For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist.  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader and the Plant Manager.  The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\n* Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\n* On-Site Conditions: The audit team reviews the program elements based on observation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\n* Interviews:  Evaluation of the program elements by interviewing personnel from appropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\n\nTeam members record RMP program deficiencies identified during the audit on the checklist.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe DWP incident investigation procedures describe incident reporting, investigation, and investigation reporting steps to be followed by plant personnel.  The incident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event.  The DWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and implements the recommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence.
