This facility is located at 515 Middleton Street, St. Joseph, Missouri.  The toxic chemical that is stored within the facility is that of Chlorine in 150 pound cyclinders.  The most that is stored at any given point is 60 cyclinders or 9000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\nWe train our personnel continuously on the proper procedures for handling Chlorine and how to repair leaks if one occurs.  Our personnel attends annual training for the First Responders Awarness Operational Level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 (q), along with montly safety meetings.\n\nIn the past five (5) years we here at Edwards Chemicals, Inc are very proud to report that we have never had a release of Chlorine within our facility.\n\nIn case that there would be a release of Chlorinewithin our facility or during transporation of cyclinders to our clientts.  Our Emergency Response Plan consist of: our drivers and warehouse personnel, who are trained to be able to recognize the release, isolate the release and notify our contracted Emergency Response Firm.\n\nEdwards Chemical, Inc. utilizes the services of Environmental Technology and Services of St. Jospeh, Missouri as our Emergency Respose firm for accidental releases.\n\nOur worst case scenario would be that of a fire in the facility and cycliners be exposed to fire thus releasing a Chlorine vapor gas.\n\nOur most likely scenario would be that of a cyclinder being dropped and causing valve to be broken off, thus causing a release of 150 pounds of Chlorine gas into air.\n\nWe keep all our cyclinders chained up within the warehouse at all times and the warehouse manager is responsible for inspecting the storage area daily to be sure all cyclinders are secured properly.  This would prevent the possibility of having a cyclinder being dropped.\n\nEdwards Chem"
