This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release:\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason San Lorenzo Wastewater Treatment Plant is observing the appropriated engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\nSan Lorenzo Wastewater Treatment Plant is located close to the area where the plant discharges the treated water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness  and contamination.\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  San Lorenzo Wastewater Treatment Plant could have a storage maximum volume of 10,000 lbs distributed in five (5) containers.  The containers are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the injectors and then the chlorinated water is sent to one (1) injection point at the end of plant\u00bfs process. \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Ri"

      "SummaryText": "sk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 lbs) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US Census 2000, it was identified that 15,853 residents are inside the 1.3 miles radio.  No known environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 lbs container, but throughout a pipe leak.  In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.1 miles and 115 public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOP\u00bfs) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP\u00bfs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nPRASA has various SOP\u00bfs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\nFive years"

It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to containers handling and transportation, employee\u00bfs training, preventive maintenance and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated 12/13/2007."
