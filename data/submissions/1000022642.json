It also reaffirms the corporate commitment of Exel, from site facility personnel through regional support specialists and corporate health, safety and environmental managers.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\no\tExel has internal procedures that encompass the safe and proper handling, storage and transportation of the products that are warehoused on site. These procedures minimize both the frequency and severity of any accidental releases. On the rare possibility of a release, Exel follows the protocol that protecting lives is more important than protecting property. Employees are trained to alert fellow workers and then the fire department. Should a release exceed the capabilities of in-house personnel, response contractors and the fire department are provided the information they need to safely remediate the situation.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Exel Ontario and Regulated Substances Present\no\tThe Exel Ontario Distribution Center warehouses and distributes a variety of products, primarily packaged in small containers intended for consumer use. These containers are not opened on-site for any process. There are three substances that are present in quantities subject to the EPA's Risk Management Program: Isobutane (CAS # 75-28-5), Methyl Ether (CAS # 115-10-6) and Propane (CAS # 74-98-6). All three of these materials are flammable gases used for propellants in aerosol cans.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf General Accident Release Prevention Program \no\tIn addition to a strong accident prevention program that underpins compliance with Federal, state and local regulatory requirements, flammable materials are inspected to verify container integrity upon arrival. Those products not destined for immediate outbound shipment are sequestered in a separate, sprinklered storage area. Motorized and pedestrian areas as well as storage/stag"

      "SummaryText": "ing areas are clearly delineated.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Five Year Accident History\no\tIn the five years preceding submittal of this plan, including the time frame under previous management, there were no accidental releases with on-site or off-site consequences that meet EPA criteria for inclusion with this plan.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Emergency Response Plan\no\tThe emergency response plan for this facility include elements that address the responsibilities of our employees to releases or threatened releases of potentially hazardous materials, including notification of co-workers, regulatory bodies, public agencies and the corporate NEAR network. The NEAR network is staffed by highly trained, experienced individuals who can advise facility personnel on the proper mitigation steps for a release. Planning and training are also key elements of the emergency response plan, allowing the opportunity to verify and/or modify current practices and procedures.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Planned Changes to Improve Safety\no\tAnalysis of facility data such as Injury and Illness Records, Internal Audits, Safety Inspections combined with data from other Exel operations, including corporate safety staff and outside consultants is utilized to identify opportunities for improvement. Best Management Practices from related operations are evaluated against current practices to facilitate continual improvement and minimize risks to both the employees and the general public.\n\u00c2\u00bf Conclusion\no\tThe Ontario facility, through the efforts of on-site personnel supported by dedicated technical specialists, has produced and maintained a low risk climate that safely stores and subsequently distributes a wide variety of products to a myriad of end users."
