      "SummaryText": "The Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two 90-ton containers of liquid chlorine.  As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency responsibilities have been instituted which include: operating and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine, notification of trained personnel, an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event that local emergency response is needed.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario as described in this program, is the release of the entire contents of a 90-ton liquid chlorine container in ten minutes, or 18,000 lb/min.  For the worst case release scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec. and an atmospheric stability class F was used.  Using approved EPA tables and default values, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 14.0 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario as described in this program was based on a two-phase release of chlorine from a 1-inch diameter hole in a 10-foot length of pipe.  Using the EPA Guidance Document for Wastewater Treatment Facilities, the release rate was determined to be 860 lb/min. and the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.5 miles.\n\nThe chlorine accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporated operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems, and alarms.  Mitigation systems in use include complete enclosure of the chlorine system and an automatic container shut-off device.\n\nProcedures are in place to identify and record any accidents or incidents.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program, including an evacuation plan, assembly areas, and other safety information has been developed.  This program has been coordinated with the City of Baltimore's Emergency Response Program - SARA title II off-site response plan.  The off-site plan"
