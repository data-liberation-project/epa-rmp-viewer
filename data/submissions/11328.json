These policies include developing and\nimplementing a formal Emergency Action Plan that includes the following:\n\n     Emergency Phone Numbers \n          Internal Incident Notification Policy\n          C.C.C. Department of Health Services Notification Policy\n\n     Plant Emergency Alarm         \n          Recognition, Initiation, Evacuation, and Assembly\n\n     Plant Emergency Plan Responsibilities\n\n     Emergency Procedures - General     \n          Fire Incident\n          Earthquake\n          Flooding\n          Bomb Threat\n          Off-site Leaks and Spills (Transportation Incidents)\n          Emergency Procedures - Chemical Spills/Releases (General Information)\n          Section I - Chemical Spills/Releases (Other than Acutely Hazardous Materials)\n          Section II - Chemical Spills/Releases (Acutely Hazardous Materials)\n     \n     Emergency Procedures - Employee Training\n          Employee Safety Training (General Overview)\n          New Employee Training\n          Basic Operator Training and Continuous Training\n          Emergency Drills\n          Training Records\n\n     Plant Inventories and Equipment Information\n          Site Map\n          Hazardous Material Plot Plan and Tank Designations\n          Emergency Safety Equipment List\n          Chemical Inventory\n\nThere are two substances at the Polypure facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident\nPrevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR Part 68.

      "SummaryText": "substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR\nPart 68 are as follows:\n\nToxic Substances:\n\n          Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 37 percent solution in water. \n     The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 66,000 pounds\n     (24,000 pounds pure formaldehyde).\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n          Dimethylamine: The maximum amount dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately\n     54,000 pounds.\n\n\nWorst-case Scenarios:\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios\nwere evaluated and are discussed in this RMP.  As required, worst case scenarios are presented in\nthe RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternative scenarios were\nprepared for each of the toxic substances with worst case endpoints located offsite and for one\nflammable substance.  The endpoint represents the distance at which a released substance must\ntravel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The\nrelease is simply assumed to take place and the greatest amount held in a vessel is suddenly\nreleased.  The results of the worst case scenario analysis were as follows:\n\n          Toxic Substances: The formaldehyde storage tank was assumed to fail and subsequently\n     produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents.  The release was assumed to\n     evaporate over a 10-minute time period.  The passive mitigation control of the tank dike\n     were considered in limiting the release impacts.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was\n     estimated to be less than 0.19 miles."

      "SummaryText": "Flammable Substances: The dimethylamine storage tank was assumed to fail and\n     subsequently  produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents that results in a\n     vapor cloud explosion.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the\n     release impacts.  The distance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than\n     0.28 miles.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in endpoints that affect public\nreceptors.  For formaldehyde the release was assumed to occur as a result of the uncoupling or\nrupture of a  transfer hose during unloading operations into a contained area.  For flammable\nmaterials, the alternative release scenario assumed that dimethylamine was released as a result of\nthe uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations. The durations for releasing\nthese materials from a vessel/pipe for the alternative release scenarios were assumed to occur\nover a 3-minute time period for formaldehyde and a 5-minute period for dimethylamine since the\nunloading operations are supervised.  With the exception of considering that these transfer\noperations are monitored by personnel at all times, no other active mitigating controls were\nassumed to limit the releases. The results of the alternative release scenario analysis were as\nfollows:\n\n          Toxic Substances:\n                    Formaldehyde, 37 percent - 0.06 miles\n                    \n          Flammable Substance:\n                    Dimethylamine - 0.06 miles\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with\nchemical specific prevention steps have been developed. The key parts to the program are:  \n\n     Formal Company Risk Management Procedure that includes:\n          Management System Responsibilities\n          Risk Management Plan Coordinating Review Team\n          Risk Management Plan Changes and Updating"
