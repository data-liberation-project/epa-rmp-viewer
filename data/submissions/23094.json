EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nThe following is a resubmittal of RMP ID Number 1000 0003 3741 for the Georgia-Pacific Resins, Inc. facility located in Conway, North Carolina.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Resins, Inc. (GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Conway, NC.  The facility is located on Ampac Road and is adjacent to the GP Hardboard plant.  The resin facility consists of three plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1959 , a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins, and a Spraydry facility that dries resin manufactured by the resin plant.  The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1980. The Spraydry facility was constructed in 1995.  Overall, the facility employs 110 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Conway, North Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Conway Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Conway Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Conway Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Conway Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n-a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) a"

In fact, the Conway Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Con't)\n \n GPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Conway Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n \n GPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n \n GPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to "

This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Conway Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n \n 1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n \n GPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Conway Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n \n In the event of an accidental release, the Conway Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n \n In order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1.

The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario\".  GPRI does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Conway Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n \n The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n \n When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n \n The RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n \n-one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3\n \n-one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1."
