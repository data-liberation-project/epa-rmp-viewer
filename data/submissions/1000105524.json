(PCS) facility is located on Highway 3115 between Highway 75 and 30 in Geismar, Louisiana. The facility manufactures Nitrogen based fertilizers and industrial grade Nitric Acid and Ammonium Nitrate (liquid only). The facility also stores oleum for use in an adjacent manufacturing facility. The Applicable NAICS codes are 325311 and 325312. The regulated substances on site that are above the threshold quantity are ammonia, oleum and a flammable gas mixture (Ammonia Process - Primarily Hydrogen and Natural Gas). The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 due to the applicability of the NAICS code. The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (ARS), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, have been performed for all the listed toxic chemicals at the facility. The EPA RMP Comp program was used to perform the offsite consequence analysis for the facility for the ammonia releases and the STAWaRS model was used for the oleum releases. The reported worst-case scenarios are the toxic chemicals that could result in the release of the largest quantity of chemical and has the greatest distance to the endpoint. An ARS was reported for each substance above the regulated threshold. The scenarios were modeled for releases that are more probable than the worst-case scenario. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario for the flammable mixture were performed using EPA default calculations for determining distances to an overpressure of 1 psi from the combustion of a worst-case release of flammable gas.\n\nThe scenarios re"

PCS strives to meet these objectives through the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs. The key elements of these programs are: \n1. Employee participation\n2. Process safety information\n3. Process hazard analysis\n4. Operating procedures\n5. Training\n6. Contractor safety\n7. Pre-startup safety reviews\n8. Mechanical integrity program\n9. Hot work permitting\n10. Management of change\n11. Incident investigations\n12. Emergency response plans\n13. Compliance audits\n\nEmployee participation\nEmployee participation is an important element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) and the Risk Management programs. The knowledge, education, experience, and skills of selected employees are used to enhance the process hazard analysis (PHA), standard operating procedures (SOPs), operator training, and the incident investigation element of these programs. PCS Nitrogen employees are selected on the basis of their experience, process knowledge, operating job task requirements, and knowledge of maintenance practices.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPCS Nitrogen's process safety information is included in the facility PSM Manual. The process safety information in the PSM Manual provides a database to support the required elements of its PSM and Risk Management programs; as well as supplying information for PCS Nitrogen employees to identify and understand the chemical, technological, and equipment hazards associated with the process. This information has been made available to all employees, including contractors, in PCS Nitrogen's Geismar complex. Process safety information includes information from the following areas: 1) Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all chemicals 2) other hazar"

Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used. PCS Nitrogen chose the \"HAZOP\" (Hazard and Operability Study) and \"What if\" processes. PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances. The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking.\n\nOperating Procedures\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product. The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, 2) Normal operation, 3) Temporary operation, 4) Emergency shutdown, 5) Emergency operation, 6) Normal shutdown, and 7) Start-up following turnaround or emergency shutdown.\n\nTraining Plan\nPCS has developed a training plan that provides a guide for the training of each employee in job related and job specific responsibilities.

The core elements of the EMP are training of personnel, roles and responsibilities, emergency action levels, emergency operations center, exercises and drills, and notification procedures. This comprehensive plan is available to all personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nPCS continually strives to improve the safety of operations and the impact on the public and the environment. PCS has fully staffed, well trained and experienced, environmental and safety departments. All members of each department work closely together to implement sound accident and release prevention programs. In addition, PCS has implemented an employee driven Behavioral Based safety program to operate alongside the traditional safety and environmental process. This program allows co-workers to observe each other's actions and anonymously report safe or unsafe behaviors and conditions. Through the dedication and effort of PCS employees working toward continual improvement of SHE programs will result in further reductions of OSHA recordables and environmental releases.\n\nUPDATE (June 2023) - The purpose of this update is to document the replacement of an existing ammonia converter with a new ammonia converter."
