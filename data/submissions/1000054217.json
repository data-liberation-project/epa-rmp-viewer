Additionally, specific training is required in all aspects of the operation of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process for those who operate the processes. Training in maintenance and repair of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process equipment is conducted with all employees who are required to maintain and repair any part of the system.\r\n\r\nDecatur Utilities has developed a chlorine and sulfur dioxide Emergency Response Program to fulfill the requirements of OSHA Part 1910.38. The Emergency Response Program is coordinated with the local and state emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 68.155 Section B\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\n\r\nThe Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has one stationary source capable of holding 12 one ton containers of chlorine as well as one stationary source capable of holding 8 one ton containers of sulfur dioxide.

      "SummaryText": "for all plant employees and is conducted every two years. First aid training is also mandatory for all plant employees and is conducted at least once every 3 years. Other mandatory training is conducted at least once every 3 years for all operators and maintenance employees and includes emergency first aid for chlorine and sulfur dioxide exposures, process safe upper and lower limits, Emergency Response Plan, operating procedures, and safe loading/unloading of ton containers. Training for all maintenance employees is conducted once every 3 years and covers process and chlorinator and sulfonator maintenance and repair, and chlorine and sulfur dioxide piping specifications.  Documentation of employee attendance at all training sessions is maintained for a period of not less than 5 years.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nAll process equipment, piping, ventilation system, monorail and hoist, have a documented schedule of inspection, and preventive and periodic maintenance.  All maintenance inspection and testing on chlorine and sulfur dioxide process equipment is conducted as per manufacturer's recommendations and is consistent with accepted engineering practices. Any deficiencies identified during such maintenance and inspection are addressed in a safe and prompt manner. \r\n\r\n\r\nPart 68.58\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nCompliance audits are conducted every 3 years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. A report of the audit findings is generated following the audit and all deficiencies or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented.  The two most recent audits are maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 68.60\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nSpecific incident investigation reporting and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in accordance with this part in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas.

The management system clearly delineates accountability and responsibility of specific elements of the program to the appropriate Risk Management Plan Team Member.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCurrent process safety information is available to all operators of the covered processes and maintenance employees in accordance with CFR 40 Part 68.48. Safety information includes current MSDS sheets, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows, process equipment and material specifications, safe operating procedures and codes and standards used in the design and construction of the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nA Hazard Analysis has been performed for the Program II covered processes. A checklist was used from Exhbits F-26, F-27, and F-28 of the EPA Supplemental Risk Management Program for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  Causes of potential accidental release scenarios were investigated and safeguards put in place to prevent a release.  The process hazard analysis was documented and is updated every five-years.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nProcess operating procedures were reviewed, documented, and refresher training conducted with all plant operators and maintenance employees.  Operating procedures cover all phases of process operations including system startup, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency shutdown. Process limits were reviewed and documented. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide safety training is performed at least once every 3 years. CPR training is mandatory"
