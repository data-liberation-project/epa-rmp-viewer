      "SummaryText": "1.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CERTIFICATION\r\n\r\n1.1\tSITE INFORMATION\r\nThe main operation of Delta Battleground Distribution Center is contract chemical warehousing and distribution.  The facility was completed and began operation in June 2004.  The facility is situated on a 5.1347 acre tract of land located at 1251 Clay Court in Deer Park, Texas 77536.\r\n\r\n1.2\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\r\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes. It is Delta's policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated substances. Delta has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response.\r\n\r\n1.3\t THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\nThe Delta Battleground Distribution Center facility's primary activity is the warehousing chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta Battleground Distribution Center receives the regulated substances in 55-gallon drums for storage.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite. \r\n\r\nChemical\t                CAS No.\r\nToxic Substances:\t\r\nEthylenediamine         \t107-15-3\r\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate\t584-84-9\r\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate\t91-08-7\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\tTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Delta Battleground Distribution Center is a Program 2 level facility.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternativ"

RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenarios for the toxic chemicals involve the dropping of a pallet containing four drums and release of their entire content inside the warehouse (est. 220 gallons at 104\u00b0F based on historical temperature records).  The alternative release scenario involves the puncture of a drum and release of its entire contents inside the warehouse (est. 55 gallons at 104\u00b0F).\r\n\r\nNone of these scenarios is likely to result in the actual loss of all the regulated substances from the vessel because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst case and alternative case scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\r\n\r\nThe Toluene Diisocyanate is kept on site as a mixture of both Toluene 2,4 Diisocyanate (80%) and Toluene 2,6 Diisocyanate (20%).  When calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, the chemical percentages are factored.  For example, a 55 gallon drum would contain 44 gallons of Toluene 2,4 Diisocyanate and 11 gallons of Toluene 2,6 Diisocyanate.\r\n\r\n1.5\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Delta Battleground Distribution Center is subject to EPCRA Section 313 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\r\n\r\nProces"

The plan covers the aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident return to work procedure.
