              "Description": "The facility maintains a Prevention Program (Program Level 3) that minimizes the possibility of an accidental release from the ammonia refrigeration system. The PSM/RMP program has been established in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Materials Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), (40 CFR 68), incorporating the elements of the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nAn Employee Participation Plan has been established with monthly safety committee meetings and active employee participation in management of the PSM/RMP program.  The General Manager is responsible for conducting monthly safety briefings on PSM/RMP topics that are developed by Corporate HSE.\n\n\n\nProcess safety information has been compiled for the covered process; this includes OEM manuals, pressure vessel information, and design considerations. IIAR2-1999 published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration is the governing RAGAGEP for ammonia refrigeration system equipment design and installation. IIAR Bulletin 110 (06/07) is governing RAGAGEP for system inspection and maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe initial process hazard analysis (PHA) of the refrigeration system was conducted in 2009 and the PHA is revalidated at 5-year intervals; representatives from the facility and corporate HSE participate in PHA revalidations. The facility evaluates system enhancements to reflect current RAGAGEP to improve safety at the facility as part of the PHA revalidation process. \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed and the SOPs are reviewed and certified annually. SOPs are filed on a cloud-based server for access and version control.\n\n\n\nAll new employees, regardless of position, are provided with ammonia awareness training. Ammonia safety awareness training is also conducted annually. All persons who are responsible for operations and maintenance (O&M) of the ammonia refrigeration system are provided with on-the-job training before they are permitted to perform O&M activities on the system. Facility O&M staff also receive Ammonia Operator training through the Garden City Ammonia Program.\n\n\n\nContractors are qualified annually through ISNetworld. The qualification process is intended to verify that contractors have appropriate training, knowledge, experience, job skills, and required certifications. Preferred Freezer Services verifies that contractor work methods are safe and acceptable. Ammonia safety flyers (in English and Spanish) are posted in public areas of the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) verification checklist and PSSRs are required for all MOCs under the management of change program element.\n\n \n\nThe refrigeration equipment is maintained based on OEM specifications and RAGAGEP. The facility performs daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections of the ammonia refrigeration system and a mechanical integrity inspection with non-destructive testing (NDT) is conducted every 5 years. The facility has adopted IIAR Bulletins 109 and 110 as RAGAGEP for conducting these inspections.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a Hot Work Program (Welding, Cutting, and Brazing) program for affected work on or around the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThe facility has implemented the corporate MOC Program and MOC forms are required for changes and equipment replacements on the refrigeration system that are not ?replacement-in-kind.? \n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented corporate ammonia odor investigation and incident investigation reporting procedures.  These are reviewed by Corporate HSE for trends and corrective actions during the annual program reviews. \n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the corporate Refrigeration Emergency Response Plan (RERP) with facility-specific emergency procedures that address system shut down and emergency notifications. A list of the agencies that must be notified upon a reportable quantity release are included in the RERP to assure the facility meets its reporting obligations and that the public is properly notified in the event of an emergency. Further, the RERP contains a list for internal notifications, refrigeration contractor, and emergency response clean-up contractor. An annual notification exercise is conducted to verify that emergency contact information is current. Evacuation drills are also conducted annually. The facility has portable ammonia detectors for use during ammonia incidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility is formally audited for PSM/RMP compliance on a triennial frequency.  Progress and resolution of audit recommendations are tracked through completion and closure.  Corporate HSE reviews the status of all previous recommendations during the annual PSM/RMP program reviews. \n\n\n\nTrade secret product and process information is not applicable to the covered process.",

      "SummaryText": "The facility's primary activity is temperature-controlled storage of food products and the facility handles anhydrous ammonia within a closed-loop refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant and the quantity of anhydrous ammonia within the refrigeration system is approximately 11,000 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  \n\n\n\nEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, which is authorized under 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), requires that facilities that have covered processes establish a Risk Management Program (RMP) to reduce the risks of accidental release of toxic or flammable materials and establish emergency response procedures in the event of an accident. This Executive Summary, in conjunction with the Prevention Program summary in this RMP submittal, summarizes key provisions of Preferred Freezer Services implementation of the RMP in conjunction with its PSM Program (herein referred to as the PSM/RMP program).\n\n\n\nA management system has been implemented to oversee the facility PSM/RMP program. The management system clearly delineates lines of authority and responsibility to ensure that all elements of the accidental release prevention programs are implemented. The General Manager of the facility has overall responsibility for PSM/RMP program implementation and compliance with the program requirements. Oversight of the PSM//RMP program is provided by Preferred Freezer Services' Corporate Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) department. Corporate HSE conducts an annual PSM/RMP program review and leads the triennial program audits and 5-year PHA revalidations. \n\n \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the facility was designed and cons"

The facility will adopt current recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) for changes to the covered process under the Management of Change (MOC) program element.\n\n \n\nAmmonia safety considerations incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system as accidental release mitigation measures include ammonia gas detection sensors in the cold storage areas (freezer and dock areas) that are interlocked shut off ammonia flow to affected portions of the system and pump the ammonia vapor from the system back to accumulator vessels in the engine room, and in the engine room that activate exhaust ventilation and initiate system shutdown.  Further, ammonia detection on any sensor at the occupational exposure limit of ammonia will activate an employee alarm system.\n\n\n\nProcess controls include an automated refrigeration control panel with micro-controllers on each compressor package. The control system is equipped with high level (liquid and pressure) cutouts and compressor interlocks to mitigate process deviations. Pressure vessels are equipped with safety relief valves that discharge to a relief vent header above the facility in the event of a system over pressure condition. The facility is equipped with an Emergency Control Station (manual cross-over and dump panel) that enables system pressures to be manually equalized, or the Fire Department to dissipate ammonia pressure through a water flow dilution device.  Manual emergency shut down and exhaust ventilation controls are also provided at the outer entrance to the engine room.  \n\n\n\nPreferred Freezer Services has implemented an emergency action plan that documents procedures for emergency system shut down and notifying personnel and emergency responders in the event of an ammonia emergency at the facili"
