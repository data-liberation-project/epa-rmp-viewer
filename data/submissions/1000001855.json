      "SummaryText": "Southmost Regional Water Authority (SRWA) Reverse Osmosis (RO) facility, operated by Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB), is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Brownsville Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass providing public drinking water using reverse osmosis treatment of well water. We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is chlorine, which is used for disinfection of the water.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 16,000 pounds.  To evaluate the worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario analyses, we used the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance and EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard (1998 edition). The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our sationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Southmost Regional Water Authority maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nOperating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered process (i.e., chlorination)"

      "SummaryText": ", Southmost Regional Water Authority maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining: SRWA has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  \n\nMechanical Integrity: Southmost Regional Water Authority carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: vent systems, controls and pumps, and monitor systems. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices by Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) and/or Texas Water Utilities Association (TWUA). Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits: SRWA conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation: SRWA promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nAccidental Release Histor"

      "SummaryText": "y: SRWA is a new facility and, as such, there have been no accidental releases during the previous five years. We will implement and maintain stringent release prevention policies.\n\nEmergency Action Plan: SRWA carries a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes coordinating with the City of Brownsville to respond to emergencies.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: Because the facility is new and the treatment technology is new to most of the facility operators, Southmost Regional Water Authority intends to emphasize training for operators."
