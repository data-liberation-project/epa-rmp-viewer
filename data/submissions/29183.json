      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIt is the intent of the City of Bessemer City to provide for chemical safety for all its employees, as well as the general public. Our overall approach to chemical safety is to keep employees well informed and trained concerning the chemicals through a comprehensive safety policy which contains Hazardous Communication and Emergency Response. Bessemer City is committed to providing for a safe workplace from Management to the Supervisors for safety of all its employees. Procedures, checklists, and logs are kept to ensure that these policies are followed.\n\nOur facility is a 3.0-MGD conventional dual media filter water treatment facility. Chlorine is used in the process for oxidation and disinfection, potassium permanganate for oxidation and control of taste and odor, aluminum sulfate for coagulation, sodium hydroxide for alkalinity and pH control, and fluoride for improvement in dental hygiene. The primary activity is to produce a safe finished water product for drinking, domestic, and recreational use.\n\nAs mentioned above we use chlorine gas which is the regulated substance contained within this report. This substance is used daily, feeding from 2 - 1 ton cylinders, additional 2 - 1 ton cylinders are stored for reserve use, and again, the chlorine is in gas form and is injected into the water at various points for the purpose of oxidation as well as disinfection.\n\nThe only worst case scenario listed in this plan is for the release of chlorine gas by a tank rupture, fusible plug blow out, or through a faulty cylinder valve. Since the cylinders are stored in a closed in facility the release to the outside environment would be very minimal; however, we have shown that there is a possibility of the chlorine gas traveling approximately 0.8 miles before dissipation. Although we have listed a population of 10 that may be affected we do not perceive this happening due to the chlorine being 1 1/2 times heavier than air and would seek the lowest points along"

The population listed is much higher than the path of travel and would only be affected should the wind carry the gas up hill and even then we would anticipate a very minimal effect. Due primarily to the above conditions we chose to use the OCA Guidance for this scenario.\n\nThe rules and regulations that we follow concerning the use, accidental release, and prevention is the OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Act) CFR (Code of Federal Register) 29 19 I0.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. In our Process Safety Management Plan are written instructions on how to handle chlorine pertaining to off loading cylinders and changing cylinders. We require specific trained individuals to off load or change cylinders and require fire personnel in full turnout gear to be present in all instances of off loading or changing of cylinders. We keep a log of who enters the chlorine storage area, reason entering storage area, the duration that these persons are in the storage area, and if there were any accidents and/or incidents. These individuals are required to sign and date these logs. Our PSM requires us to have alarms that are visual and audible in the event of a chlorine leak and instructs the facility employees on what to do and who to call by a Chain of Command Chart and an Emergency Response Plan.\n\nWe are proud to say that within the last ten years we have had no accidental release of chlorine.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with our local Fire Department, which is on County Communications with the Gaston County Emergency Management. Again, we have a Chain of Command for the supervisor and employees to follow. Our individuals who handle the chlorine cylinders are trained annually in safe handling of chlorine and a drill is conducted at the facility annually for employee escape and as mentioned, we have a visual and audible alarm system.\n\nThe only upcoming planned events that we have is  the continued annual training o"
