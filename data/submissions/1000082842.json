INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan as it pertains to Cordova - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health, environmental, and regulatory responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975. \r\n\r\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cordova Fire Department and/or other emergency response organizations arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \r\n \r\n\r\n3.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE and THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nWe use three regulated substances at our facility in a quantity regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and 3M contributes to their safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance programs. \r\n\r\nThe following regulated substances are used at Cordova - 3M Company:                                                                                   \r\n- Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), a non-flammable corrosive acid, which is a key raw material used for products to replace ozone-depletin"

Prior to selecting a contractor, 3M conducts an evaluation of the contractor's safety performance.  We have a  policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to 3M processes and the contractor's work.  Contractors are also informed of 3M procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.   \r\n\r\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\nAt Cordova - 3M Company, no level of accident is acceptable.  We work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations.  The Cordova site has experienced no off-site impact events involving RMP chemicals listed in this plan in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\n3M's first line of defense against accidents is to take action to prevent them, as described elsewhere in this executive summary.  However, at Cordova - 3M Company we also work to ensure that we are prepared for any accident that might happen. We maintain a written emergency response plan that includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas. \r\n\r\nWe conduct regular drills-including joint training with the Cordova Fire Department and other local emergency response agencies - to ensure the proper execution of our plan.  Our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Our emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes in our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  Also, Cordova - 3M Company has a fully trained emergency squad on site at all time.\r\n\r\nCordova - 3M Company also participates in the ACC (American Chemistry Council) Responsible Care Program.\r\n\r\n7.
