BEI Hawaii eliminated several other chemicals and reduced the chemical inventory amount.  Chlorine use especially by swimming pools and sewage treatment plants is being eliminated and substituted with bleach or hypochlorite in powdered or tablet form depending on the  of the facility.  This will enable BEI Hawaii to reduce the chlorine inventory."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is prepared for BEI Hawaii - Barbers Point facility.  BEI Hawaii developed site specific Risk Management Plans for its facilities that are regulated under risk management programs to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements; Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and to protect public safety and environment.  The goal of our risk management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to our employees, the general public, and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of an accidental release.      \r\n\r\nThis RMP consists of four chapters.  Chapter 1, Introduction and Management System, introduces the plans and describes the facility operations, management and responsibilities.  Chapter 2, Hazardous Assessment, provides an overview of the chemicals stored in our Barbers Point facility, their hazard release consequences and impact in worst case and alternative scenarios.  Chapter 3, five-year accident History, provides the guideline for accident release investigation.  Chapter 4, Prevention Program, BEI Hawaii is utilizing its OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to meet the RMP Prevention Program requirements since all RMP Prevention Program elements are covered by OSHA PSM program.  PSM is specific to each chemical and each process.  Chapter 5, Summary of Emergency Response program, provides the guideline for what to do in case of emergency. \r\n\r\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nBEI Hawaii believes in a clean and safe environment and is dedicated to meeting all applicable environmental standards in the operation of its businesses and services.  BEI Hawaii has established comprehensive policies and procedures for the operations of its facilities.  The policy is a commitment to environmental compliance that assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to the Ch"

      "SummaryText": "ief Executive Officer of the company, or designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.   The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment, and to protect the environmental from pollution.\r\n\r\nPreservation of the environment is a commitment that must be shared by all employees.  Employees shall promptly report suspected violations of environmental laws, regulations or permits to their supervisor who shall take immediate action to verify the report and, if confirmed, stop the violation and take remedial or other appropriate action.   The incident shall be promptly reported to BEI Hawaii - Regulatory Compliance Officer, who will assist in making any necessary reports to regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe overall approach to chemical safety begins with the premise that safety is everyone's responsibility and working safely is a condition of employment. Workplace hazards are minimized through preventive measures such as facility and equipment design, purchase of less hazardous products and development of standard operating procedures. Control measures include facility inspections to discover potential problems, employee reports of hazardous conditions, training and a safety award program.   \r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \r\n\r\nOur BEI Hawaii - Barbers Point facility is located at 91-150 Kaomi Loop, Kapolei, on the island of Oahu.  The site is leasehold with Campbell Estate being the leaseholder and consists of approximately 6.2 acres.   The site is bounded on the north by Chevron Hawaii Refinery, south and east by undeveloped parcels, and the Pacific Ocean and shoreline to the west.  The facility stores mostly bulk industrial chemicals.  The products are mainly warehoused at the facility and distributed to various locations throughout Oahu, as well as throughout the State of Hawaii.  This facility also manufactures bleach, the main ingredients of which are chlorine and liquid caustic.  The regulated subst"

      "SummaryText": "ances handled at this facility are chlorine, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and anhydrous ammonia.  All the materials are prepackaged by manufacturers  in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved cylinders or tankers.  BEI Hawaii receives them from the chemical suppliers and distributors located on the West Coast.  The suppliers are responsible for container inspection and maintenance.  Because bulk sales are made directly to customers, access to the facility is not restricted.\r\n\r\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\r\n\r\nBEI Hawaii has an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place covering its operations. This PSM program meets the requirements of the preventive RMP and is thus utilized as the prevention section of the BEI Hawaii-Barbers Point facility's RMP.  All sections of the RMP prevention program are covered in the OSHA PSM program.   The OSHA PSM plan and documentation are maintained in the Regulatory Compliance Officer's office.  \r\n\r\nFour PSM plans have been developed for this facility which includes storage of chlorine, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), anhydrous ammonia, and bleach manufacture (sodium hypochlorite) plant.  For the storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), the important practices to the prevention program are proper storage and handling of the cylinders.  Proper loading and unloading of cylinders from trucks are very important to prevent cylinders from falling and causing possible damage to the valve area.  For the storage of anhydrous ammonia, the important practices to the prevention program are proper handling of the transport tank.  Training and careful work practices are the key to preventing accidental damage to the cylinders.  For the bleach manufacture plant, the important practices to the prevention program are: having a careful and cautious operator, proper operation of the equipment following the standard operation procedures, inspection and testing the equipments following the good"

The further details of each element of each process are described in Barbers Point facility's four PSM plans.  \r\n\r\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no accidents and no release that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage from sulfur dioxide and ammonia during the last five years.  \r\n\r\nThe facility had very small emissions of chlorine gas from two fusible plugs on a one-ton cylinder on May 22, 2009.  The release was estimated less than 3 lbs and it was sealed within about 15 minutes.  A bulge was noticed on the bulkhead of the cylinder which resulted a precautionary evacuation in the Campbell Industrial Park.  As noted publicly, the precautionary evacuation was to ensure the safety of the general public.  There were no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, or environmental damage on site and off site.  \r\n\r\n5.  Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe BEI Hawaii - Barbers Point facility is classified as a non-responding facility.  As such, BEI Hawaii has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee/community safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response with an in-house response team.  The BEI Hawaii - Barbers Point Facility has developed its own procedures as outlined in the BEI Hawaii Safety and Health Program incorporating information from Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities and others.  BEI Hawaii has coordinated response to incidents with the Honolulu Fire Department Hazmat Team located in Oahu.  Operators are capable, however, of responding to incidental releases such as routine tightening of a valve, for example. \r\n\r\nBEI Hawaii - Barbers Point facility personnel will only perform defensive mitigation measures (i.e., secure areas, initiate water spray, etc.) to limit the release until a response team arrives to establish the incident command.  We have discussed this pro"
