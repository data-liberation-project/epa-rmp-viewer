      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a))\nThe accidental release prevention release policy employed by EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are typically followed.  The emergency response policy of EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and complies with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  The goal of the spill policy of EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. is to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and that will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b)) \nThe primary activity at West Rifle Compressor Station is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is NGL, which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include methane, ethane, butane, propane, pentane, iso-pentane, and iso-butane.  These regulated chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility is 59,998 gallons, which contains approximately 355,400 lbs. of regulated flammable chemicals.  Additionally, the Facility has three 300-b"

The worst-case scenario was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the 30,000-gallon NGL storage tank forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which detonates.    For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions.  Using the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.45 miles from the Facility.  Based on a visual survey of the adjacent properties within a 0.45-mile radius of the facility, the population within the WCRS area is estimated to be ten (10).  Six industrial facilities are the nearby public receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.45 miles of the Facility.  Environmental receptors, as defined by 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.45 miles of the Facility, were not observed based on review of United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps.  Figure 2 shows the Facility relative to the WCRS maximum distance area depicted by a circle with a radius of 0.45 miles centered on the Facility.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario (40 CFR 68.155(c)) \nThe EPA document Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used to determine the consequences of an Alternative Case Release Scenario (ACRS) for the Facility.  Two separate situations of vapor cloud explosions were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure: a process piping release caused by the failure of an inlet piping valve "

The Emergency Response Plan describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment.  The Emergency Response Plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance. In the event of a NGL accident, first aid procedures for exposure, as well as, procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan. A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the appropriate local authorities.  A site map is included in the Emergency Response Plan. This Emergency Response Plan is kept at the Facility separately and should be referenced in the event of a release.  The Emergency Response Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to reflect changes at the Facility and the covered process and the employees are informed of changes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(g) \nEnCana is committed to operating the West Rifle Compressor Station in a safe manner with regards to personnel, the public, and the environment.
