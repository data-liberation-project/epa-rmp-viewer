      "SummaryText": " of all personnel is periodic and on going.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Identification\n\nThe facility is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment facility that uses chlorine gas for disinfecting approximately 5.0 mgd wastewater effluent.\n\nChlorine gas is stored in a concrete block building located in the center of a 44 acre fenced compound.  Entrance to the compound is restricted and the chlorine building is kept locked at all times.  A maximum of 15 ? 1 ton full cylinders are stored within the chlorine building.  Only 1 ton cylinder is in use at any one time.\n\nWorst case Release Scenario\n\nThe EPA RMP*Comp program was used to estimate the distance to the end point if a catastrophic release of chlorine should occur.\n\nAssuming an accident occurred while off loading a 1 ton cylinder from the delivery truck, the following scenario was developed.  1 ton of chlorine gas was released at a rate of  200 pounds per minute over a 10-minute period.  The result is an off site exposure to chlorine gas above the toxic end point of 0.0087 ppm to a radius of 1.3 miles.\n\nNo passive mitigating measures were considered to be in effect during this scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe accident history for the Wastewater Control Plant was reviewed to determine the most realistic alternative scenario to consider.  There has not been a catastrophic release of any kind since 1981, the start up of the City of Bend?s Wastewater Control Plant.  Therefore, a ?what if? scenario was developed using worst case wind speed, temperature, and gas stability data.  The passive mitigation measures include a closed building.  Active mitigating measures include vacuum/pressure regulating valves, and automatic exhaust fans.\n\nThe ?what if? assumption that was used is a s follows.  A pipe attached to the chlorinator valve cracked allowing the gas in the piping to be released.  This equals 3.74 pounds to be released over a period of 10 minutes.  The toxic end point of 0.0087-p"
