              "Description": "*EU-1592* The Cedar Bayou facility complies with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals, and has applied the programs and policies found in the standard to activities throughout the entire plant.\n\nSpecific program elements include:\n\n1. Employee Participation ? It is the policy of Cedar Bayou to seek participation of employees at all levels in establishing procedures and practices that govern Health, Safety and Environmental issues (Fire & Safety Guideline (FSG) 1.20, Employee Participation Policy, outlines this process);  \n2. Process Safety Information ? Process safety information is maintained for each operating area (FSG 1.30 Process Safety File Management System outlines this process);\n3. Process Hazard Analysis ? A detailed hazard assessment, using the HAZOP and WHAT-if/Checklist methodologies, is conducted on all processes to insure that they have been designed safely.  The process also includes a Layer of Protection analysis; \n4. Operating Procedures ? A system is in place to ensure that updated and approved procedures cover all aspects of process unit operation;\n5. Training ? A training program has been established to ensure that all personnel are well trained in the specific duties of their jobs (The process also includes an annual Training Needs Analysis);\n6. Contractors ? It is Cedar Bayou?s objective to partner with contractors that share the same safety philosophy.  A dedicated, collective, and consistent approach by Cedar Bayou and contractors will enhance and maintain the safety and health of our respective employees FSG 7.10 (Contractor Plant Safety Procedures) outlines this process;\n7. Prestartup Safety Review ? A prestartup safety review walk down and checklist is completed for each managed change that significantly impacts the Process Safety Information.  FSG 4.75 (Formal Facility/Equipment Acceptance Procedure) outline this process; \n8. Mechanical Integrity ? An equipment inspection program is in place to ensure equipment remains in good condition to prevent releases;\n9. Hot Work Permits ? A work permit system is in place to ensure that all work on process equipment and all hot work are conducted in a safe manner.  F&SG 4.18 (Safe Work and Hot Work Permit Procedure) outlines this process;\n10. Management of Change ? A management of change system has been established and implemented to ensure that any change is thoroughly reviewed prior to implementation.  FSG 4.02 (Management of Change) outlines this process; \n11. Incident Investigation ? Incidents are investigated using one of several industry recognized methodologies, such as Why Tree, to determine system level root causes that can be remedied to prevent a reoccurrence. Employees and contractors involved in the incident are included on the investigation team.  F&SG 3.12 (Incident Investigations) outlines this process; \n12. Emergency Planning and Response ? An emergency action plan has been established for the entire plant including procedures for handling small releases of chemicals.  The plan is known as the Integrated Contingency Plan;  \n13. Compliance Audits ? Programs are audited annually through the VPP self assessment; at least every three years through PSM compliance audits; every three years through an internal corporate sponsored Operational Excellence/Compliance Review; and weekly safety inspections of the facility are conducted by  cross functional teams.  Action items resulting from these are tracked to a timely completion; \n14. Trade Secrets ? Access by employees to information has few restrictions. Contractor?s access to information is managed based on their involvement in PSM and the day to day activities of the plant.",

              "Description": "*NAOU-1798* The Cedar Bayou facility complies with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals, and has applied the programs and policies found in the standard to activities throughout the entire plant.\n\nSpecific program elements include:\n\n1. Employee Participation ? It is the policy of Cedar Bayou to seek participation of employees at all levels in establishing procedures and practices that govern Health, Safety and Environmental issues (Fire & Safety Guideline (FSG) 1.20, Employee Participation Policy, outlines this process);  \n2. Process Safety Information ? Process safety information is maintained for each operating area (FSG 1.30 Process Safety File Management System outlines this process);\n3. Process Hazard Analysis ? A detailed hazard assessment, using the HAZOP and WHAT-if/Checklist methodologies, is conducted on all processes to insure that they have been designed safely.  The process also includes a Layer of Protection analysis; \n4. Operating Procedures ? A system is in place to ensure that updated and approved procedures cover all aspects of process unit operation;\n5. Training ? A training program has been established to ensure that all personnel are well trained in the specific duties of their jobs (The process also includes an annual Training Needs Analysis);\n6. Contractors ? It is Cedar Bayou?s objective to partner with contractors that share the same safety philosophy.  A dedicated, collective, and consistent approach by Cedar Bayou and contractors will enhance and maintain the safety and health of our respective employees FSG 7.10 (Contractor Plant Safety Procedures) outlines this process;\n7. Prestartup Safety Review ? A prestartup safety review walk down and checklist is completed for each managed change that significantly impacts the Process Safety Information.  FSG 4.75 (Formal Facility/Equipment Acceptance Procedure) outline this process; \n8. Mechanical Integrity ? An equipment inspection program is in place to ensure equipment remains in good condition to prevent releases;\n9. Hot Work Permits ? A work permit system is in place to ensure that all work on process equipment and all hot work are conducted in a safe manner.  F&SG 4.18 (Safe Work and Hot Work Permit Procedure) outlines this process;\n10. Management of Change ? A management of change system has been established and implemented to ensure that any change is thoroughly reviewed prior to implementation.  FSG 4.02 (Management of Change) outlines this process; \n11. Incident Investigation ? Incidents are investigated using one of several industry recognized methodologies, such as Why Tree, to determine system level root causes that can be remedied to prevent a reoccurrence. Employees and contractors involved in the incident are included on the investigation team.  F&SG 3.12 (Incident Investigations) outlines this process; \n12. Emergency Planning and Response ? An emergency action plan has been established for the entire plant including procedures for handling small releases of chemicals.  The plan is known as the Integrated Contingency Plan;  \n13. Compliance Audits ? Programs are audited annually through the VPP self assessment; at least every three years through PSM compliance audits; every three years through an internal corporate sponsored Operational Excellence/Compliance Review; and weekly safety inspections of the facility are conducted by  cross functional teams.  Action items resulting from these are tracked to a timely completion; \n14. Trade Secrets ? Access by employees to information has few restrictions. Contractor?s access to information is managed based on their involvement in PSM and the day to day activities of the plant.",

The Cedar Bayou Plant is located on the North side of Interstate 10 between Cedar Bayou and Sjolander, and is situated on approximately 1,000 acres.  The plant was initially built by Gulf Oil and began operating in 1963.  In 1984, it became part of Chevron through the Chevron-Gulf merger, and is currently part of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP, as the result of a joint venture.\n\nThe basic business of Cedar Bayou is to produce simple olefins, which include ethylene and propylene, and derivatives which include polyethylene resins, normal alpha olefins, and polyalphaolefins.  These products are primarily ?intermediates? which are processed further by our customers to produce finished consumer products.  End uses for our products include: plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubes and hydraulic fluids, and waxes.  Chemicals used at the facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity include flammable mixtures which may contain such chemicals as; Methane, Ethylene, Butene, Hexene, Ethane, Methanol, Propane and Propylene; and toxics such as boron trifluoride, aqueous ammonia, chlorine and titanium tetrachloride.  Process PAO-1791 has been shut down and is not expected to run again.  It is currently being demolished.  Therefore, it has been removed from the RMP.\n\nElaboration on Accident Prevention\n\nThe Cedar Bayou facility complies with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals, and has applied the programs and policies found in the standard to activities throughout the entire plant.\n\nSpecific program elements include:\n\n1.

A large capacity truck is used to minimize tubing connections and to decrease truck traffic on roadways.\n\nChemical specific preventions for titanium tetrachloride toxic OCAs include: an operator in attendance during the entire titanium tetrachloride unloading process can isolate the system remotely while the catalyst supervisor audits the unloading process.  Unloading hoses are designed for a higher pressure service than the system would normally require.  These stainless steel braided hoses are provided with additional support to prevent unnecessary binding or crimping.  When not in use, the hoses remain hooked up under nitrogen pressure to prevent moisture from degrading the hose integrity.\n\nChemical specific preventions for chlorine toxic OCAs include: replacing the transfer hose every year (the hose is hastelloy with a Teflon lining with a five year estimated life).  There are four chlorine sensors located at all four quadrants of the chlorine cylinder pad.  The detectors alarm at 3 ppm and initiate a chlorine alarm in the local control room.  In addition, lights flash and horns sound in the area of the chlorine cylinders.  An automatic shut-off valve is mounted on the chlorine cylinder after installing the hose during change-out of the cylinder.  The valve will close automatically if there is a chlorine leak detected.  The valve can also be manually closed from the WT control room for the cooling tower chlorine cylinder and from the Main Utilities control room for the clarifier cylinder.

The smaller release footprint obtained from aqueous ammonia does not make if off-site.   Chemical specific preventions for aqueous ammonia toxic OCAs include:  the containment basin is designed for full volume release; the tank vent space is vented back to the delivery truck during unloading process to minimize air emissions; and an operator is in attendance during unloading operation and can block in the truck if needed.  The ammonia tank is filled by an overhead line with a dip tube into the vessel.  A manual alarm on the unit is used to notify personnel in the immediate area of a release. \n\nELABORATION ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nALARM SYSTEMS: Cedar Bayou has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies.  In addition, the Baytown alarm system can be activated in the event of incidents with potential offsite consequences.\n\nTRAINED EMERGENCY RESPONDERS:  To protect onsite workers and property, Cedar Bayou has fully trained volunteer responders covering all four rotating shifts to ensure 24-hour coverage.
