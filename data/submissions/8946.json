Market Street\nGreensboro, NC 27407\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including \nemployees that Flav-O-Rich Dairy, Greensboro, NC is \ncomplying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard \n(called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of \nFederal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk \nManagement Program regulations (called RM Program), Title \n40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the \nstorage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. \nIn this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public \nsafety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the \noccurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant \nreleases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, \nand other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these \nprograms prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and \nillnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving \nhazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nmanufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such \nchemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of \nvessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which \nare located such that a hazardous chemical could be \ninvolved in a potential release shall be considered a \nsingle process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on \nthe rules, procedures, and practices which govern \nindividual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. \nThese rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They \nare also communicated to and accepted by all employees at \nthe facility.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCESS\n\nThe Greensboro Facility is an ice cream processing, freezing, and storage\nfacility.  The facility uses ammonia in an industrial refrigeration system\nto maintain temperatures in milk tanks, coolers, glycol chillers, ice builder,\nand freezers. The refrigeration system is also used to freeze ice cream.\nAmmonia"

      "SummaryText": "refrigeration is the only process subject \nto the Risk Management Legislation. \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 17500 lbs. \nof ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80 % of \nthe vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a \nten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, \nammonia could travel 1.7 miles before dispersing enough to \nno longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: worst- case weather \nconditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a \nbuilding that would withstand and help to contain such a \nrelease; industry standards for the manufacture and quality \ncontrol of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in \nthis service; pressure safety valves limit operating \npressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in \nplace at the facility including the mechanical integrity \nprogram for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, \nand replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed \nammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and \nthe auto-dialing system in place to warn operating \npersonnel of process upsets; and the emergency response \nplan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nRupture of a 1/2 line in the engine room would result in a release of \n150 lbs. of ammonia over a time period of ten minutes. Under common \nweather conditions, ammonia could travel .1 miles before dispersing \nenough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This particular \nscenario was chosen as an alternative because it is in an area of the \nplant where it could be struck and result in a release. \nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: all \nforklift drivers are made aware of the dangers of ammonia and are \nproperly trained; the accident prevention program in place at the facility \nincluding operating procedures to have personnel present at \nall times during any forklift use, and the mechanical \nint"

      "SummaryText": "egrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and \ntesting, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; and \nthe emergency response plan and equipment in place at the \nfacility.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been two reportable accidents at the facility in the past \nfive years.  The first incident involved the release of ammonia into \nthe sewer system.  Water which had been used to purge ammonia vapor \nwas accidentally disposed of into the storm sewer.  The quantity \nreleased was approximately 48 lbs. and there were no injuries or \nevacuations as a result of the incident.  Since this incident, \nthere has been substantial training on the hazards of ammonia.\n\nThe second incident at the facility happened on January 2, 1997.  \nA liquid feed line vibrated loose in the production area.  The \nfacility estimated that it lost 100 pounds of ammonia.  The fire \ndepartment was called and they limited access to the plant as a \nprecautionary measure.  The leak was fixed in two hours, and the \nammonia never reached off the premises.  As a result of this incident,\nthe emergency training has been updated and operating procedures have\nbeen changed.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the \nOSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR \n1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We \nhave trained employees for emergency response and maintain \na written emergency response plan.\n\nThis plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct \nannual drills for implementation of the emergency response \nplan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and \nthe fire department. The facility is equipped with a siren \nto warn the community of an emergency. The last training at \nthe plant was on August 14, 1998."
