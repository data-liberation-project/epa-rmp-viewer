On April 30, 2004, the facility assets were purchased by INVISTA S.a r.l.\n\n\n\n1.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nINVISTA Orange Site (INVISTA) management is committed to preventing process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, off-site communities, the environment, or result in significant property or business loss. We firmly believe that we can operate our processes without inuring or endangering employees or the community. \n\n\n\nOur policy for process safety management is to comply with INVISTA Process Safety Management Standard, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68). The INVISTA Orange site's Risk Management Program contains the management systems and controls for our diversified processes so that potential hazards are identified, understood, and controlled. It is the responsibility of each individual employee to know, understand, and comply with the site process safety management policy and systems. \n\n\n\nManagement ensures that employees are involved in all aspects of the Risk Management reviews, auditing, and development of procedures and training programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe INVISTA Orange Site is located approximately 2 miles South of the city of Orange on FM 1006. The site is located on 72 acres and the facility is secured by a chain-link fence, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24 hour security force. DuPont as the land owner is responsible for security and emergency response for the site. \n\n\n\nThe site consists of manufacturing processes to produce Nylon Intermediates [hexamethylenediamine (HMD) and Adiponitrile (ADN)]. The Adipic Acid (Adipure) unit was decommissioned during the 4th quarter 20"

In the production of HMD and ADN, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials, intermediates, or by-products:\n\n- Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\n- Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater)\n\n- Chlorine\n\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n\n- 1,3-Butadiene\n\n\n\nA barge dock was commissioned within the last 6 months for supplying 1,3-Butadiene to the ADN production unit or sending 1,3-Butadiene offsite. The barge dock is manned whenever a barge with 1,3-Butadiene is at the barge dock. The barge dock has controlled entry, is secured by a chain-link fence, and the area is under video camera surveillance from the ADN unit control room. A compliance audit required under 40 CFR 68.79 is planned for the site during October 2016, which will also include the 1,3-Butadiene supply by barge at the barge dock. The U.S. Coast Guard conducted an audit of the facility prior to startup on August 11, 2015 and the deficiency corrections were approved on Aug 25, 2015. The most recent inspection was conducted on January 16, 2016 by the U.S. Coast Guard. \n\n\n\n1.2 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances and corresponding processes at INVISTA are also regulated under the OSHA PSM standard. The PSM and RMP programs share common accidental release prevention requirements and corresponding program elements. In complying with the PSM standard, INVISTA has taken the necessary steps to comply with the applicable accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nINVISTA's Accidental Release Prevention Program incorporates safety into process and equipment designs:\n\n- A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.\n\n- Extensive accident prevention and mitigation systems are strategically located.\n\n- Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n\n- Materials of construction are chosen"

However, on October 10, 2012, the site had a release of a regulated substance that resulted in two onsite injuries.  The release was attributed to an upstream isolation valve that was not fully closed when a downstream flange was removed.  Contributing factors to the event include implementation of procedures for energy control and establishment of perimeters during line break activities.\n\n\n\n1.4 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nPlant personnel are trained and equipped to"
