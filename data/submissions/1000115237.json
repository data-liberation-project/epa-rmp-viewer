These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\nLegendary Meats is a domestic producer of custom cuts beef, poultry, pork, veal, lamb, seafood and dry goods for foodservice and retail operators.  The Legendary Meats plant is located at 1058 King Industrial Dr. in Marietta, GA, Cobb County.  \nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration Systems.\" Approximately 17500 lbs. for the Front Engine Room (ER1) and 6,000 lbs. for Back Engine Room (ER2) of ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility's two systems.  A total of 23,500 lbs. of ammonia onsite. Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled onsite is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, condensers and evaporators used throughout the ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas.  Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility.  This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, p"

How to determine the WCS & ACS was derived from the EPA approved ALOHA & CAMEO Software and Gaussian Dispersion.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents associated with the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department will be notified so that they can provide assistance during an incident. If it is necessary to contact the public regarding an ammonia release, the local fire department will be contacted to coordinate with the police department. The police department will notify residents and business locations.\nThis facility has not had a reportable release in the past five years.  The facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure mitigation and control of potential incidents.\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during the Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity inspections to improve the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and implemented in a timely manner.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nLegendary Meats is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.

If such a release does occur, our trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release from a safe distance.  We coordinate with Marietta Fire and Emergency Service which provides first responders emergency response expertise.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\".  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program\nLegendary Meats has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLegendary Meats currently maintains a record of written process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe methodology used to carry out the analysis is a What If Analysis Checklist.  The analyses are undertaken by a team of personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Legendary Meats maintains written operati"

Refresher training will be provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLegendary Meats conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations by a qualified refrigeration technician.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Legendary Meats to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice at Legendary Meats.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLegendary Meats conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.
