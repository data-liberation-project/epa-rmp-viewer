(WPX) at the Glenn Fox Pad. This report provides the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the recovery skid system, pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. EPA RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe system is designed to remove liquids from gas at the wellhead, having an inlet pressure between 150 and 400 psi. The refrigeration system can operate at a chilling temperature as low as -40?F. Recapture Solutions uses this system to remove liquids from flared gases. The portability of the unit allows it to easily be moved from site to site when flaring ceases. The PortaPack (LPG storage portable tank) is the only storage tank for liquid products, and has 18,000 gallons capacity. Recapture Solutions limits the maximum fill to 85% of the tank volume when the product temperature is above 0?F, 82% when the product temperature is below 0?F, or 80% when the product temperature is below -35?F. For the purpose of this assessment, the PortaPack is assumed to be only be filled to 8,000 gallons which is equivalent to 33,934 lbs. of flammable liquids.\n\n\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMP plans must be prepared for pr"

Recapture Solutions can store approximately 57,146 lbs of LPG and exceeds 10,000 lbs. threshold, thus the facility is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare a RMP. However, due to the proximity of a residence, the storage of the LPG will be limited to 8,000 gallons or less so that the facility will be subject to the Program 1 requirements.\n\n\n\nDISPERSION MODELING ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe dispersion modeling analysis for accidental gas release into the ambient air was evaluated by URS using EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis which is based on the TNT- equivalent model to evaluate the worst-case release scenario and identify the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. Besides the release and meteorological conditions discussed above, the analysis also utilized the rural ground surface roughness. The modeled Distance-To- Endpoint was 0.26 miles. The modeling output listing for the worst case scenario is included in Section 5. There is a small hill between the tank and the nearest public receptor and it will block some of the potential impact, but the effect could not be predicted for this analysis although a drawing showing the terrain is included in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nDISPERSION MODELING ANAYSIS RESULTS URS Modeled Results\n\n\n\nResults of Consequence Analysis\n\nScenario Summary\n\nJune 16, 2014\n\nChemical Name CAS Number Quantity Released (pounds)\n\nPropane    74-98-6    33,934 (8,000 gallons)\n\nThreat type:    Flammable Gas\n\nScenario type: Worst-case\n\nPhysical State: Liquefied under pressure\n\nRelease type:  Vapor Cloud Explosion\n\nEstimated distance to 1 psi overpressure: 0.26 miles\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS: POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT\n\n\n\nA field survey was used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to the flammable endpoint and to identify public r"

The types of public receptors and environmental receptors identified within the impact area are listed in Table 2-2. area map, the distance to the nearest public receptor from the facility is approximately 0.27 miles, which is beyond the 0.26 mile distance to the level of concern. Additionally, no environmental receptors are impacted by the worst-case release scenario."
