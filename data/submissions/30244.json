This is a \ncomprehensive plan that encompasses all aspects of the City of Oldsmar?s WWF \nmethods and procedures of receiving, handling, processing and worst as well as \nalternative accidental release scenarios of hazardous chemicals on site. \n\n\n    Emergency response Policies:\n\nThe City of Oldsmar Wastewater Facility?s response to emergencies is controlled \nby 4 main elements/policies: \n\n> Risk Management Plan\n> Process Safety Management\n> Chlorine Emergency Response Action Plan\n> Sulfur Dioxide Emergency Response Action Plan\n\n\n\nThe management of the City of Oldsmar?s Wastewater Facility has had a safety \nprogram in effect since 1991. Since inception, the program has undergone \nextensive change. The evolution process has taken this program from the early \nplanning, research and development stages to a well defined, structured and to \nthis date, safe & successful program. This is evidenced by a track record with \nrespect to ?employee time lost? and ?vehicle time lost, accident? awards \nreceived from the National Safety Council. This years? requirement for the RMP, \nPSM, and other accompanying plans provide an opportunity to update, re"
