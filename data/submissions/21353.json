If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sales of fertilizers to farm producers in our area.  Circle D Ag  anhydrous ammonia operation has been  at this location for over 13 years.\n\n    a.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n    b.  The maximum quantity stored would be 105,000 pounds\n\n3.  Worst-Case   Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n    a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release of the anhydrous ammonia from our major storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint is 2.6 miles.\n\n    b.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles.\n\n    c.  Adminstrative Controls:  During the off season for crop production or inventory is reduced to approximately 21,000 pounds.  During this period the Worst-Case Scenario would be the release of approximately 10,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint would be approximately 1.2 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  After normal duty hours the local police department inspects our area.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour telephone number and appropriate action is taken.  The fire department conducts annual fire inspections of the facility.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases"
