The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk ManagementPlan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nThis is a correction to the 5-year RMP update filed on 6/21/04.  The correction type is C02, additional information supplied.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHawaiiAmerican Water Company provides wastewater collection and treatment for unincorporated communities east of the City of Honolulu.  Its wastewater treatment facility, East Honolulu Wastewater Treatment Plant, uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located across Kalanianaole Highway from Sandy Beach State Park.  There are 13 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container s"

The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent for aquatic toxicity control.  Pressurized gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators or sulfonators located in a separate room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of HawaiiAmerican Water Company that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, HawaiiAmerican Water Company has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by HawaiiAmerican Water Company are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for HawaiiAmerican Water Company's operations.  HawaiiAmerican Water Company has instituted formalized program and document management procedures which are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHawaiiAmerican Water Company's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Honolulu County Department of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies and evacuation of persons on site to designated assembly areas upwind of the released gas.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which HawaiiAmerican Water Company committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
