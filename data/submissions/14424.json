This is demonstrated by our facility's commitment to the practices of OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), other OSHA standards, and established environmental practices.  Our facility is operated in strict accordance with written operating and maintenance procedures.  The operations are ISO 9002 certified, which results in a continual improvement of the plant safety program.  The application of the ISO program and PSM ensures rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to accidental releases.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.\n\nThe Orange facility receives and stores chemicals used primarily for the manufacture of synthetic rubber, which are used to make many consumer goods, such as:\ny Tires;\ny Adhesives for diapers;\ny Hot melt adhesives;\ny Food containers;\ny TV and VCR cabinets;\ny Toys;\ny Automobile components; and,\ny Medical equipment and supplies.\n\nOur facility handles only flammable materials that are regulated under the USEPA RMP rule.  These flammable materials are 1,3 Butadiene and mixed butenes. \n\nThe worst case flammable release scenario is a technical evaluation of a hypothetical,  accidental release of a flammable material due to a complete failure of the largest storage vessel.  According to EPA requirements, this analysis assumes  that all safety systems at the Orange Plant on this vessel  fail simultaneously, and the weather conditions at the time of the release are the most favorable to maximize the potential consequences of the EPA defined worst case flammable release.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  Based on our "

Safety control systems are allowed to operate as designed and the weather conditions are more representative of the area. The alternative release scenario for the Orange Facility assumes a four inch hole develops in the 1,3 butadiene storage tank, or related piping, which causes a 19,345 pounds per minute leak that lasts 60 minutes.  There is a subsequent explosion. This scenario has off-site consequences, but does not have any impact on residential receptors.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility. This scenario is useful for developing Emergency Response Plans with our local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\nOur Safety Programs Include:\n\nDesigning for Safety\n\ny A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.\ny Applicable codes and standards are met.\ny Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.\ny Quality Assurance ensures equipment is suitable for its application.\ny Design changes are documented and reviewed\n\n \n\nOperating Safely\n\ny Operators are trained\ny Technical resources are available as required\ny Operators follow approved procedures\n\nMaintaining Our Plant\n\ny Maintenance personnel are trained and experienced\ny Contractors are trained and qualified\ny Mechanics follow approved maintenance procedures\ny A work permit system controls hazardous work\n\nAuditing Our Operations\n\ny Routine safety inspections are conducted\ny Audits and reviews are conducted.\ny Process Hazard Analyses are performed\ny Safety critical equipment is periodically inspected to ensure"
