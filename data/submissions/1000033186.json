      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\r\nKansas Ethanol, LLC\r\n\r\nThis RMP resubmission is being submitted to fulfill the 5-year update requirement of CAA Section 112(r).\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nKansas Ethanol, LLC has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, personnel training the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\r\n\r\nKansas Ethanol has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; Facility Response Plan; and Emergency Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\r\n\r\nKansas Ethanol's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nKansas Ethanol is located in Lyons, Rice County, Kansas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\r\n\r\nWORSE CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\r\nWorst Case Scenarios:\r\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of t"

      "SummaryText": "10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n\r\n2.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tanker contents, equaling 42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 14,280 pounds was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112 (r).  Public receptor information was obtained using LandV"

No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \r\n\r\nThe Kansas Ethanol facility qualifies as a Program 3 for anhydrous ammonia, the facility includes the flammable mixture as a Program 3 for RMP/PSM purposes for consistency throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\r\n\r\nKansas Ethanol's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations.  Written weekly and monthly visual inspections are performed and the reports are on file in the Safety Manager's office.  Quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports filed per KDHE requirements.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated with RMP covered processes at the Kansas Ethanol facility.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nKansas Ethanol has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including the Health and Safety Plan and Facility Response Plan.  Kansas Ethanol has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the facility Emergency Action Plan.  The Plans listed as part of this Executive summary have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations, as necessary.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nKansas Ethanol provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis.  Any changes to improve safety will be implemented immediately upon discovery of needed changes."

A determination spreadsheet is included as part of this documentation detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are also provided as part of this documentation.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 165,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 924,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, equaling 924,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 314.16 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112 (r).
