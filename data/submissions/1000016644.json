      "SummaryText": "Sur-Gro Plant Food Company in Dearborn, Missouri is an agricultural retailer of fertilizers and crop protection products to farmers in a 20-mile radius of Dearborn.  We maintain two anhydrous ammonia storage vessels that are connected.  Our storage units each contain the internal excess flow valves that provide positive shut-off of product flow in the event of a hose or pipe failure.  This would exist under adverse weather conditions such as hanging clouds, high humidity and wind.  Sur-Gro Plant Food Company will contact the local Mid-America LEPD to respond to any accidental releases of product from our storage vessels.  Internally, Sur-Gro Plant Food Company is pro-active in identifying work hazards, and communicating those hazards to our employees, through regular safety meetings.  Sur-Gro Plant Food Company believes that all level of employees are responsible for health and safety of those employed by Sur-Gro Plant Food Company as well as the community in which it operates."
