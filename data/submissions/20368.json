This document has been prepared in order to address\n\nthe following issues:\n\n\n\n     - Repeal of the State RMP Program as delineated in HSC 25531-25543.3.\n\n     - Promulgation of the Federal RMP program per 40 CFR 68.\n\n     - Adoption of the Federal program requirements by the State of California.\n\n     - Acknowledge the facility change of ownership.\n\n     - Acknowledge the addition of processes at the facility which are subject to RMP\n\n       requirements.\n\n\n\n     The RMP represents a revision of the previously required state document to incorporate\n\nthe federal requirements as outlined in 40 CFR 68. Federal RMP requirements give facilities until\n\nJune 21, 1999 to file the RMP, but the General Duty clause of the 40 CFR 68 regulations requires\n\nall facilities to properly:\n\n\n\n     - identify hazards\n\n     - design and maintain a safe facility\n\n     - prevent releases\n\n     - minimize consequences of releases.\n\n\n\n     The accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented risk\n\nmanagement and prevention program which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will\n\ntake to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. Ripon Cogeneration, Inc. (RCI) has chosen to\n\nprepare and implement its RMP in advance of the federal program due date in order to fulfill its\n\nobligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the\n\nsurrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\n\n\n     Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 the following summary is given:\n\n\n\n         The RMP applies to the Ripon Cogeneration, Inc. facility located at\n\n          944 South Stockton St., Ripon, CA. 95366.\n\n\n\n         The Ripon Cogeneration Facility is a gas turbine based cogeneration facility rated\n\n          at 49.9 M"

The gas turbine is equipped with\n\n          a Selective Catalytic Reduction system for the control of Oxides of Nitrogen. The\n\n          SCR system utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the reactant in the catalyst. Ammonia\n\n          is stored in a stationary storage tank rated at 18000 gals., but state law and site\n\n          operating procedures limit the tank capacity to no more than 4500 gals.\n\n\n\n         The facility utilizes five (5) ambient ammonia sensors and alarms in the tank area\n\n          as well as a single sensor for ammonia in the machinery room.\n\n     \n\n          Leak detection is confirmed by the cogen operator console and the water\n\nsuppression system is automatically initiated. The water suppression system is designed to mitigate\n\na major portion of any tank related release.\n\n\n\n         The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary\n\n          source are delineated in Sections 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.1.\n\n\n\n         Worst Case release scenario is the failure or the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.\n\n          This scenario results in the release of approximately 28900 lbs. of ammonia. The\n\n          distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.4 miles and affects approximately 10800\n\n          individuals.\n\n     \n\n         Alternative release scenario is the rupture of the main section of ammonia\n\n          distribution piping. This scenario results in the release of approximately 9257 lbs.\n\n          of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 0.4 mile and\n\n          affects approximately <=1000 individuals.\n\n\n\n     Piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic \n\n     valves which effectively limit the amount of any accidental release.
