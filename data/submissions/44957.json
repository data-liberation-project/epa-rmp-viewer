The company?s 15,000 employees worldwide make and market high-value agricultural products.  Monsanto's World Headquaters is located at 800 N. Lindbergh Blvd in Creve Coeur, Missouri.\n\nOne of the locations contributing to this vision is Monsanto's manufacturing facility located in Muscatine, Iowa, at 2500 Wiggens Road.  Approximately 400 employees at this facility manufacture a variety of herbicide active ingredients and formulate them into finished goods for consumer use.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan report is being triggered by the five year anniversary of the most recent update of the RMP, which was dated 2/15/2001.\n\nThe major elements of the RMP prevention program are very similar to the OSHA PSM regulation.  OSHA has conducted an audit of our facility under their Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and, in 1995, the Muscatine Plant was awarded their highest rating - \"Star\".  In 2001, the Muscatine Plant received the VPP Star Recertification.  The Monsanto Muscatine Plant is also a 2000 charter member of the EPA National Environmental Performance Track (NEPT).  NEPT is a voluntary partnership program that recognizes and rewards private and public facilities that demonstrate strong environmental performance beyond current requirements.  In 2004, the Muscatine Plant recevied it's NEPT Recertification.  Receipt of these awards demonstrates a long standing and continuing commitment to the safety and health of employees and the surrounding community as well as protection of the environment.\n\nMonsanto's Muscatine, Iowa facility has a documented Emergency Response plan that includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemen"

There are personnel responsible for implementation of this procedure on site at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the Muscatine County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Fruitland Volunteer Fire Department.  Should an incident occur which could jeopardize the safety and health of personnel in the area surrounding Monsanto plant, the following events would occur:\n\n    -Monsanto's emergency response team would be called upon to control the incident,\n    -the Muscatine County Sheriff would be notified, and\n    -if needed, community emergency response resources would be called upon for assistance.\n\nThis facility maintains an inventory of four chemicals regulated by the RMP:  ammonia, chlorine, formaldehyde, and isopropyl amine.   The consequences of several release scenarios for each chemical has been calculated using methods provided by the EPA.\n\nThe worst case scenario for each chemical requires that the entire contents of the vessel be discharged to the atmosphere in a 10 minute period.  This would be an extremely rare event and very unlikely to occur.   The worst case toxic release scenario for this plant involves the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a chlorine rail car.   The worst case scenario for a flammable is similarly the complete and instantaneous release of a full rail car of isopropyl amine and a resulting vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nThe regulation also requires an analysis of alternate release scenarios.  Monsanto has evaluated several release scenarios for each chemical, including unloading hose failure, rupture of the largest nozzle on the storage tank or rail car, and relief device failure.\n\nDuring the past five years, the facility has had one accidental release from a cov"

The incident occurred on July 11, 2002, in which a pipeline, under pressure, was accidentally opened and approximately 100 pounds of isopropyl amine were released.  An on site injury resulted but there were no injuries or impact to the surronding community.  The Emergency Response Plan was activated and their actions effectively dealt with the incident.  This incident was investigated per Monsanto procedure, and all recommendations made by the investigating committee have been completed.\n\nThe Muscatine Plant employs a comprehensive collection of safety systems to maintain the equipment and work practices utilized in our operation.  Some examples include:\n\n  -A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every 5 years or more frequently.  This involves a team of experts who review the hazards posed by the chemical, best industry practices for handling the material and a defined system to identify hazards.  Recommendations for improvement are made and priority placed on implementing them in an prompt manner.\n\n  -Our mechanical integrity system requires regular inspection of the equipment, relief devices and other systems utilized in handling the material.\n\n  -Instructions have been developed to provide detailed actions for employees operating the equipment.  They are reviewed annually with active involvement from operating personnel.\n\n  -A change management system is utilized for modifications to equipment and operating parameters.  Each change is appropriately reviewed by a team of personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\n\n  -The site utilizes a number of contract personnel for a variety of services.  Our Contractor/Guest program requires that contractors be selected using their actual safety performance as a criteria and open communication must exist between Monsanto and contract employees to identify and control hazards.\n\nIn addition, we utilize a number of systems for specific chemi"

Examples include:\n\n    -area monitors to quickly detect leaks,\n    -emergency chlorine tank car repair kit,\n    -water sprinkler systems to extinguish process fires, and\n    -excess flow valves which will stop chlorine flow under certain conditions.\n\nBoth the general and chemical specific systems work together to minimize the frequency and consequences of chemical releases.\n\nThis brief summary provides some insight into the extensive system Monsanto utilizes to maintain safe operations.
