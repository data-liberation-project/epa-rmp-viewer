The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program(mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components,and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices(such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to operate or work on the refrigeration system. Supervalu also has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure that the PSM/RMP program is being implemented  at the facility. Lastly, the PSM/RMP written program incorporates the SuperValu Fort Wayne facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.

      "SummaryText": "SuperValu Inc.'s (SuperValu) Fort Wayne Distribution Center (DC) is a wholesale food distribution facility serving retail stores throughout Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.  SuperValu's Fort Wayne Distribution Center is located a 4815 Executive Blvd. in Fort Wayne, In employs approximately 146 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management (RMP) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and OSHA Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM).  To date SuperValu's Fort Wayne DC has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment.   \n\n   \n\nPursuant to RMP/PSM regulations, SuperValu has developed a comprehensive PSM/RMP written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and subsequent 5 Year PHA Revalidations for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA's were completed using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as ammonia refrigeration contractors and Corporate Personnel. \n\n\n\nSuperValu's implementation of the PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired t"

      "SummaryText": "o work on the refrigeration system. \n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SuperValu has undertaken a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of ammonia from the largest vessel in the refrigeration system. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.\n\n\n\nSuperValu is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the refrigeration process at the Fort Wayne DC.  Facility Management is involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. SuperValu's employees are involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management is committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at SuperValu should be address to Kevin Bleed Facility Manager at the Fort Wayne DC and/or SuperValu's Environmental Affairs Department (Dale Patton)\n\n"
