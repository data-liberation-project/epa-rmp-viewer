The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases.  Investigations will be undertaken by a team to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future. Corrective actions are tracked until they are completed. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe facility regularly conducts audits of the provisions of RMP and PSM to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  A compliance audit of each program is conducted every three years. The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Findings and corrective actions taken in response to each finding are tracked until completion.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe processes at the facility include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The PSM Program elements summarized previously apply to the anhydrous ammonia and denaturant processes. Collectively, these program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.

The facility has developed an employee participation program as part of the PSM program.  All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\r\nThe facility utilizes the HAZOP PHA methodology.  The PHA identified the following potential major hazards:  toxic release, fire, explosion, over-pressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, and natural disasters such as tornados.  The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, excess flow devices and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases. The facility also utilizes dike containment around the facilities storage tanks, including the denaturant storage tank, to contain and mitigate liquid releases.\r\nFHR Shell Rock keeps a variety of technical documents onsite that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility and provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Training\r\nFHR Shell Rock is responsible for developing and implementing written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the PSM.
