      "SummaryText": "Crescent Midstream operates pipelines transporting crude oil from offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and from other pipeline operators to refiners and to other pipeline operators. The Raceland facility receives crude oil from pipelines and pumps the crude oil to Crescent\u0092s downstream customers. The Raceland facility operates a PHMSA breakout tank for pressure control purposes. The Raceland facility also injects butane into the crude oil stream. Butane is delivered to Raceland via tank trucks and stored in two tanks on site. Butane from the storage tanks is metered into the crude oil that is pumped out of Raceland. The butane storage vessels were formerly DOT trailers and will be maintained and inspected as ASME pressure vessels. The storage vessels will not be prevented from being used for road transport.\nButane is the chemical of interest for this RMP. The RMP requirements apply to the unloading of liquid butane into the storage tanks, the storage of the butane and the injection of the butane into the crude oil pipelines leaving the facility. The two storage vessels will  have a combined storage capacity of 166,000 pounds of liquid butane.\nThe Butane system is also regulated under the OSHA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations. The remainder of the facility is regulated under PHMSA\u0092s Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline (49 CFR 195). In addition to the EPA\u0092s Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68), the Raceland facility is also subject to the Oil Pollution Prevention regulations (40 CFR 112). \nThe storage of butane and its injection into the export pipelines began operations in October 2024. There is no accident history for this operation. The five-year accident history for the Raceland facility has had a single oil release of 852 barrels of crude oil from a temporary storage tank while the site\u0092s breakout tank was out of service for inspection. This release occurred in July 2024 and was investigated by PHMSA. The release did not result in injuries o"

These requirements include meeting with the local emergency response organizations and conducting drills, both desktop and field drills.\nWith the addition of butane storage and injection at Raceland, Crescent Midstream will be meeting with local emergency response organizations to both update them on the new equipment and to develop plans for responding to a butane release."
