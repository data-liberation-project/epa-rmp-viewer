Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nFXI, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nFXI, Inc.is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Cornelius, NC. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\n\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2,4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in Storage Tanks within the tank storage area and delivered via tanker truck. For safety reasons, these tanks are never filled past 90%.  \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2,4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the Off-Site Consequence Analysis, facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 1 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nC.  "

An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\n\n\nD. Hazard Assessment: (OCA)\n\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc. to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\n\nA catastrophic release of one 20,000-gallon railcar of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI) into the secondary containment located outside a permanent building has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  It is assumed the catastrophic release would release the entire contents of the railcar. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method "

The impact distance does not extend beyond the facility property line.\n\n    \n\nThe alternative scenario is not required due to the worst-case scenario not extending beyond the property line.  \n\n          \n\nE. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nFXI, Inc. - Cornelius is an RMP Program Level 1, but still chooses to follow many RMP Program Level 2 sections for the additional EHS benefits. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: FXI, Inc. has developed written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where TDI is utilized. These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI system. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice. FXI, Inc. has developed and implemented safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the TDI facility.\n\n\n\nTraining: FXI, Inc. will continue to provide training for each employee associated with the TDI system. This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.54.  Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. FXI, Inc. documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: FXI should develop a written preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the TDI process (i.e., storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, et"

Five-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  \n\n\n\nG. Emergency Response Program\n\nFXI, Inc. has developed and implemented an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. \n\nThis program includes the following elements: \n\n1. An emergency management plan, which is maintained on site and contains at FXI the following elements:\n\n   a. Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies;\n\n   b. Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary for   \n\n      Accidental exposures; and\n\n   c. Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of TDI.\n\n2. Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection.\n\n3. Training for all employees in relevant procedures; and\n\n4. Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency management plan to reflect changes at FXI, Inc. and to ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nH. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn an attempt to ensure a continual improvement in the facility worker protection and release prevention programs, training will be conducted at FXI, Inc. every three years on this program.  This program requires the attendance of personnel whose job is related to the TDI system.  Additionally, audits will be performed as specified in the RMP plan, which requires FXI, Inc. to assess areas of the RMP plan that may need to be changed or improved.\n\n"
