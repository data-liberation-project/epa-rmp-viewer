Active mitigation systems at the Site include level controllers on the storage tanks and automatic shutoffs to prevent vessel overfilling.  The property is protected by firewater and sprinkler systems, inspected annually by an outside independent company.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\r\n\r\nThermo Fisher has a fully developed emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  The plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  The Site plan has been shared with the Bridgewater Fire Department to help ensure a coordinated response.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, Thermo Fisher works closely with local, county, and state agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency.  For additional information on what actions to take in the event of an emergency, contact the Bridgewater Fire Department.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThermo Fisher Scientific has created a culture that strives for continuous improvement of its environmental, health, and safety program.  The Company trains employees to safely perform their assigned tasks and encourages employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help improve safety and performance.  Preventive maintenance is performed on facility equipment to minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment.  The Site systems and programs are audited annually, typically by an outside company/3rd party auditor, to evaluate their effectiveness."

These analyses have been completed and the results reported in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Registration as appropriate.  \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant releases of any of the regulated materials in the last five years of plant operation.  A significant release would include a release resulting in some type of offsite impact including injuries, evacuations, environmental damage, onsite injuries, or significant property damage.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nThe Operations Managers have the overall responsibility for ensuring that their respective facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  The Process Safety Engineer has responsibility for implementation of the Site risk management program (RMP).  Thermo Fisher has developed programs to comply with all required environmental, health, and safety standards.  \r\n\r\nThe Company takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Site process management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs, including:\r\n\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process hazard analysis\r\n- Compliance audits\r\n- Operating procedures\r\n- Accident investigation\r\n- Training\r\n- Employee participation\r\n- Mechanical integrity\r\n- Hot work permit\r\n- Contractor safety\r\n- Management of change\r\n- Pre-startup Review \r\n\r\nThese individual elements of the Site risk management program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Site management programs, the Company has designed both passive and active mitigation systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases.  Passive mitigation includes those design features that are essentially fail-safe.  In other words, they will successfully operate to control or contain a potential release, without the need for elect"

      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThermo Fisher Scientific is the world leader in serving science. Thermo Fisher began its operations in Bridgewater in early 1970.  Today, the Bridgewater Site receives, repackages, and distributes chemical products to research, healthcare, industrial, educational, and government facilities. Thermo Fisher is also a leading supplier of occupational health and safety products and maintenance, repair and operating materials.\r\n\r\nThe Bridgewater Site consists of two main buildings situated on 59 acres.  The site consists of offices, maintenance shops, quality control laboratory, repackaging systems and warehouse storage areas.  The facility operates 16 hours per day, 5 days per week.  Employee count is approximately 200, and varies with the business needs.  \r\n\r\nNOTE ON RE-SUBMISSION\r\n\r\nThis RMP Registration is being re-submitted to meet the requirements of 40CFR part 68, which requires that the RMP must be fully updated and resubmitted at least once every 5 years.  Included in this resubmission is an update of all nine sections of the RMP for Thermo Fisher Scientfic's Bridgewater Site.  Some chemicals either no longer handled at the site or no longer handle above threshold reporting levels have been eliminated from the plan.\r\n\r\nFACILITY OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Bridgewater Site has two primary functions: to receive and repackage chemical products, and; to distribute those products to its customers.  The receiving and repackaging area is known as the Bridgewater Packaging Facility (BPF).  The Repackaging Facility receives chemical product in various containers, ranging from 55-gallon drums to tank wagon and rail car quantities.  No covered chemicals are received at the Bridgewater Site in rail cars.  Product is repackaged into containers of various s, ranging from milliliter  to drum and tote containers.  \r\n\r\nRepackaged product is then stored in, and distributed from the National Distribution Center (NDC).  The Distribution Center consists of warehouse storage, includ"
