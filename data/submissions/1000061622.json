Lyssy uses these procedures for reference by experienced personnel and to provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\r\n\r\nOperating procedures are reviewed and modified whenever there are changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or facility.  Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lyssy Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive training on the Lyssy Hub's Operating Procedures, and basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator understood the training. Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems. Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; lockout/tag out, management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Lyssy Hub uses contractors to supp"

The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Lyssy Hub management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Lyssy Hub conducts compliance audits every three years.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nEOG Resources, Inc. \r\nLyssy Hub\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nEOG Resources has a longstanding commitment to public welfare and worker safety.  EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:  design, training, operating parameters and regular maintenance.  Through design efforts, we have limited the public exposure.  Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively.  Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment.  And regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\r\n\r\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the  conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\r\n\r\nFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Lyssy Hub is located in a rural area in Wilson County, Texas.  This facility is a natural gas dew point control plant with condensate stabilization utilizing fixed and skid mounted processing equipment as well as liquid storage tanks. \r\n\r\nMarplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst case scenario but there are two potential public receptors.  These potential public receptors are housing units located:\r\n 1.  West at 1,838', and \r\n 2.  South at 1,769'.  \r\n 3.  In addition there is seasonal activity associated with agriculture that cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nThere are no public receptors within the area of the alternate release scenario. Additionally, there are no environmental receptors in either the worst case scenario or the alternate release scenario area.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe referenced process at the Lyssy Hub is regulated under both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP)) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Ma"

      "SummaryText": "nagement (PSM) standards.  Since the scope of these two programs encompass much of the same material, we have presented the pertinent information following the outline establish in the PSM program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployee participation is mandated by the corporate PSM manual.  In response to this mandate the Lyssy Hub has:\r\n 1.  Created a matrix of required employee participation.\r\n 2.  Posted information for employee participation in the Control Room.\r\n 3.  Reported the finding for PHAs, Compliance Audits and incident investigations during regularly scheduled Safety Meetings.\r\n 4.  Directly involved employees in the establishment of maintenance and operating procedures.\r\n 5.  Sought input for training, both in subject matter and timing from employees.\r\n 6.  Trained all employees in the Management of Change (MOC) process.\r\n 7.  Included employee input in the Process Safety Information (PSI).\r\n 8.  Included employees with appropriate knowledge in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).\r\n 9.  Made all information associated with Accident Prevention available to all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Lyssy Hub actively encourages employee participation in all aspects of operation and safety.  The result is a more invested group of personnel and an ever increasing accident prevention awareness.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Lyssy Hub maintains a variety of information used to analyze the steps necessary to ensure the safe operation of the process.  This information includes:\r\n 1.  Inventories of regulated chemicals.\r\n 2.  Data on chemical properties and associated release and exposure hazards and appropriate responses.\r\n 3.  Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams.\r\n 4.  Relief and vent system studies and designs.\r\n 5.  Process design as well as operating parameters and limits.\r\n 6.  Safety interlocks.\r\n 7.

      "SummaryText": "10.  Historical operating records.\r\n\r\nLyssy Hub then uses this information to assess potential hazards, modify maintenance steps and frequency, adjust operating procedures, change process and equipment functioning limits as well as alter safety requirements necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Lyssy Hub uses the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) findings to improve operating procedures, consequence of deviations and mechanical integrity.  The PHA systematically evaluates each process for potential hazards and then recommends change where needed.  These PHAs are revalidated every five years.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team is selected from management and employees.   Members are chosen based on their knowledge in operating and maintaining the process and engineering expertise.\r\n\r\nThe Lyssy Hub considers a variety of factors when conducting the PHA using acombination of the What if and HAZOP methods for evaluating potential hazards.  Some of the factors considered are:\r\n 1.  All Process Safety Information (PSI).\r\n 2.  Cause and Effects.\r\n 3.  Human factors.\r\n 4.  Public health.\r\n 5.  Environmental factors.\r\n 6.  Safeguards in place.\r\n 7.  Facility siting.\r\n 8.  Incidents, accidents and near miss reports.\r\n 9.  Management of Change (MoC) information.\r\n10.  All previous PHAs.\r\n\r\nThe results of the PHAs are published and made available to all personnel.  The PHA follow-up items are promptly addressed based on their priority ranking.  The responses to the PHA recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Lyssy Hub retains these records of previously PHAs. \r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Lyssy Hub maintains easily obtainable written operating procedures that address various aspects of the process.
