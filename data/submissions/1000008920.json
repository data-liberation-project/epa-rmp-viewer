This commitment to safety is exercised daily.  Personnel from every department take active roles in quality assurance, accident prevention, training and community involvement.  To this end, the facility maintains a standing Safety Committee that meets regularly to address safety concerns and formulate solutions.  In addition, Oak Farms is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, which brings together various industry and government representatives to plan for a community-wide response in the event of chemical releases that may impact the public. Oak Farms is also involved in an ongoing effort to comply with regulations at the local, state and federal levels that require accident prevention, planning, training, and response.  This informational brochure has been prepared to address some of these requirements.\n\nApplicable Regulations\nThe Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan at Oak Farms Dairy comply with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention: Risk Management Plan.\n\nFacility Location and Regulated Substances\nThe Oak Farms Dairy facility located at 1314 Fredericksburg Road in San Antonio, Texas is equipped with a refrigeration system that contains anhydrous ammonia (C.A.S. #7664-41-7). Ammonia is the sole regulated substance in regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccident Release Prevention\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system "

Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerent. \n\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe facility experienced a very small leak from the packing of a small valve on March 1, 2009.  Approximately one pound was lost; however, the wind was blowing toward the case dock and one employee with asthmatic was taken to the clinic as a precautionary measure.\n\nEmergency Response Program and Policies\nWritten emergency action procedures are maintained at the facility.  All employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  Oak Farms has an agreement with a third party response contractor to be notified in the event of an uncontrolled release.\n\n"
