Approximately one pound was lost; however, the wind was blowing toward the case dock and one employee with asthmatic was taken to the clinic as a precautionary measure.\n\nEmergency Response Program and Policies\nWritten emergency action procedures are maintained at the facility.  All employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  Oak Farms has an agreement with a third party response contractor to be notified in the event of an uncontrolled release."
