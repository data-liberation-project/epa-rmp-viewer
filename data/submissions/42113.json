      "SummaryText": "This is a brief overview of the RMP and policies of EnCana Company's Dry Creek gas plant near Bridger, Montana, that is operated by NorthWestern Energy.\n\nLocation and Status\nThe Dry Creek East Line plant is located near Bridger, Montana in Carbon County.  The facility is in a remote area at Section 34, Township 6 s, range 21 east.  The plant is located on approximately 15 acres of land, some ten miles southwest of Bridger, Montana.  The plant is owned by EnCana Company, but contracts with NorthWestern Energy to operate the plant.  The plant continues to process approximately one and one-half million cubic feet of gas per day.\n\nThe plant has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\nHistory and Ownership\nThe plant was originally constructed by Darenco, Inc. as a gas processing facility for Montana Power Company.  In 1997, through an internal reorganization, Montana Power Company's oil and gas operations (NARCO) assumed responsibility for the plant.  In October of 1999, the plant was sold to EnCana and Montana Power was contracted to continue to operate the plant.  In 2002, NorthWestern Corporation purchased Montana Power and changed the name to NorthWestern Energy.  Since that time, NorthWestern Energy has operated the plant's operations for EnCana.   \n\nProgram Level\nNARCO originally determined that the Dry Creek plant is a Level 1 facility because there are no identified public receptors within the range of the worst case release scenario.  There have been no incidents meeting the criteria in the RMP rule in the past five years and plant personnel have coordinated the emergency response plan with the local response agency.  The plant is covered under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard.  \n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the plant Emergency Respons"

      "SummaryText": "e Plan and the Emergency Planning and Response section of the Dry Creek plant RMP manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the County Disaster and Emergency Services department (LEPC) and agency personnel have toured the facility.  NorthWestern Energy takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \n\nNorthWestern Energy management understands its' duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding area.  \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe plant is a natural gas fractionation facility designed to extract certain hydrocarbon liquids from the inlet gas stream.  This is done to make the gas stream pipeline ready as the dew point must be at a certain level to permit the gas to be transported via pipeline, safely.  The company has installed many safety systems to ensure that the inlet compression, processing, storage and distribution systems function safely. \n\nPropane, butane, and other petroluem products are by-products of the natural gas processing done at the plant.  These flammable substances are managed with great care given their inherent hazards.  The company invests in equipment upgrades as necessary to ensure the operations remain safe.  In addition, there are maintenance procedures, parts controls, internal engineering standards, and ongoing personnel awareness training. \n\nInternal and external audits are done to ensure the plant is in a continual improvement process.  Audits may be regulatory or management systems in nature, but in any case are done as part of the plant's objectives.  Results are reported to management and corrective actions taken and tracked as indicated. \n\nThe liquids storage tank is filled only to 80% of capacity.  This is done as an administrative control to ensure overfilling or over pressuring of "

      "SummaryText": "a tank cannot occur.  Trucks are used to transport product from the plant.  Farstad Trucking is allowed access into the plant without prior authorization from personnel in the plant office, so plant administration knows when a truck is on premises.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific action steps are described in detail in the Dry Creek PSM/RMP Manual and the plant emergency response plan.\nElements in the program include or refer to:\n- Employee participation\n- Process safety information\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Operating and maintenance procedures  \n- Training\n- Contractor management\n- Pre startup procedures\n- Mechanical integrity requirements\n- Hot work procedures\n- Management of change procedures\n- Incident investigation\n- Compliance audits\n\nAccident History\nThe plant has not experienced any accidents that meet the criteria specified in the standard in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies.   The plan meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95.  The plan is designed to protect personnel on the site, to ensure their safe and orderly evacuation in event of an emergency, and to provide appropriate information and protection for response personnel.   The program is reviewed and updated as needed on at least an annual basis."
