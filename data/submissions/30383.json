This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of Tetra?s processes.  Tetra's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n2.0  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n    Tetra is located in an agricultural area that borders West Memphis, Arkansas.  Tetra produces zinc/calcium bromide blends in water solutions that are used as high-density workover and completion fluids in the oil and gas industry.\nTetra was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tetra personnel identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site.  The chemicals, their largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\n    Tetra keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n    Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n    Tetra also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n    Tetra has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n    Tetra primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZop) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n    To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria:\n\n1) age of process,\n2) extent of process hazards,\n3) number of affected employees, and\n4) operating history of the process.\n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

The review is to ensure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n3.4  Training\n\n    In addition to training on operating procedures, Tetra has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations and procedures.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

The basic aspects of this program includes the following:\n\n1) training,\n2) developing written procedures,\n3) performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices,\n4) correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits, and\n5) applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\nMaintenance personnel receive training on the following:\n\n1) an overview of the process,\n2) safety and health hazards,\n3) applicable maintenance plans, \n4) emergency response plans, and\n5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Tetra incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n3.6  Management of Change\n\nTetra has a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n    The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and are adequate.  Prior to startup, Tetra determines that a PHA has been conducted, recommendations resolved, and training of employees involved in the process is verified as part of the PSSR.\n\n3.8  Compliance Audits\n\n    To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Tetra periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in the audit techniques.  The audit team develops findings in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor); and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n3.10  Employee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Tetra?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.

Examples of these include the following:\n\n1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel,\n2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,\n3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened,\n4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and\n5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n3.12  Contractors\n\n    Tetra uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Tetra has procedures in place to ensure that contractors do the following:\n\n1) perform their work in a safe manner,\n2) have ap"

Tetra ensures that a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained.  Tetra personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n4.0  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Tetra have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following sections include descriptions of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n4.1  Universal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at Tetra.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n4.2  Specialized Safety Features\n\nTetra has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and, (3) reduce the consequences (mitigate) of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process.\n\n4.3  Release Detection\n\nSensors with audible alarms are located to detect and warn"

Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.  \n? Personnel trained in emergency procedures.  \n? Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied-air breathing apparatus).\n\n\n5.0  Five Year Accident History\n\nTetra has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There has been no incident involving a regulated substance.\n\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Programs\n\nTetra maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MaC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  The West Memphis Fire Department is the first responder should there be facility emergencies.\n\n\n7.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    One of the bromine tanks will be replaced with a new updated tank.  There are no additional changes planned at this time."
