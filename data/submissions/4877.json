Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Western Farm Service's Mettler facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 9355 Copus Road, Bakersfield, California, 93313 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and Nitrosol / aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000-gallon and one 20,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 255,000 pounds.\n\nNitrosol / Aqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 6,500-gallon above ground tank at the site. The storage tank is located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of Nitrosol / aqua ammonia handled is 48,750 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 24.3% active ingredient by weight, is 11,846 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount releasing 142,800 pounds of "

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.70 miles.   The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release of 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.\n\nB.  Nitrosol / Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 48,750 pounds of Nitrosol / aqua ammonia solution within the secondary containment structure.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.86 miles.  The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release of 10,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Nitrosol / Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, s"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia, and aqua processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs. In summary, planned changes address the review and development of Standard Operating Procedures for regulated onsite processes."
