The purpose of this RMP is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1992.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n* We provide manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons (which are tested semiannually) at several locations within the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.  The ESD system will also isolate the facility from the incoming feed pipeline and outgoing product pipeline.   \r\n \r\n* We have installed gas detectors in the compressor room in order to detect flammable hydrocarbon vapors and alarm the control room.  We provided dual seals on the booster pumps.  We provided high pressure and low-flow shutdown switches on our product pipeline as well as high pressure shutdown on the demethanizer that will vent hydrocarbon vapors to the atmosphere through the relief valve.\r\n \r\n* We provide fire extinguishers throughout the facility for extinguishing incipient fires.  These fire extinguishers are inspected annually by third party inspectors and monthly by facility employees.  These safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility for many years.\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HIST"

      "SummaryText": "ORY\r\n \r\nNo incident having resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Antelope Hills Gas Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n \r\nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Antelope Hills Gas Plant with the Roger Mills County Volunteer Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Roger Mills County Sheriff, the Cheyenne Community Hospital, and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.  The Antelope Hills Gas Plant operator is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan (RSP) for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our ERP provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n \r\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Antelope Hills Gas Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we have achieved and continue to improve upon.\r\n\r\nA corporate wide electronic MOC process is being implemented to create a more consistent and comprehensive method for managing changes.  An electronic PSSR process is being implemented to ensure all aspects of physical changes are reviewed for safe and compliant installation prior to startup.  The PHA was updated as a HAZOP in 2016. Future PHAs will include LOPA and risk assessment in accordance with new company standards."

(OFS - Owner/Operator)\r\nANTELOPE HILLS GAS PLANT\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION AND POLICIES\r\n\r\nONEOK (Parent Company) is committed to being associated with unmatched environmental performance as measured by our employees, customers, regulators, and the public.  Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards for which we strive.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant (Facility) is one of many facilities operated OFS.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing the cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process in two plants capable of processing 45,000,000 cubic feet per day.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  There are two product surge tanks with a total capacity of 27,500 gallons which contain demethanized product.  This demethanized product is the only flammable substance at the facility in an amount greater than threshold quantity that is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP).  There are no RMP-covered toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation"
