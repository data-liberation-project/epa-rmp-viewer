      "SummaryText": "TThe Smiths Water and Sewer Authority in the Community of Smiths Station, Alabama has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) for the Smiths Water Treatment Plant.  It is their goal to have this plan implemented at the Smiths Water Treatment Plant in an effort to protect human health, protect the environment and meet applicable federal regulations.  This plant is operated by the Smiths Water & Sewer Authority and has a capacity to process 3.4 million gallons of drinking water per day.   It is located in Section 21, Township 18 North, Range 30 East.  The plant is located at 141 Lee Road 315, Smiths Station, Alabama, 36877.\nThe Smiths Water and Sewer Authority Water Treatment Plant has six employees, and operates 24 hours per day. The facility is a surface water treatment plant that uses Lake Oliver (Chattahoochee River) as its primary source. The treatment plant supplies potable water to approximately 9,100  customers within the City of Smiths Station and the southeast portion of Lee County, Alabama.  For the first half of 2009, the average daily finished water that was pumped from the plant was between 2 and 3.3 million gallons per day.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant during the treatment process. \nThe chlorine storage area is housed in a separate building on the premises.   This room is equipped with ventilation and alarms.  \nEmployees at the plant have received training on the standard operating procedure to follow if a chlorine leak were to occur. These instructions are located in the Standard Operating Procedures Manual and are kept in the operator control room.  Emergency telephone numbers are listed in the manuals.  These numbers include the local fire department, police department and the Lee County EMA. \nThe RMPlan has been developed to meet the standard published in the 40 Code of Federal Register (CFR) part 68.  Risk Management Program regulations were promulgated by the EPA to cover the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act"

      "SummaryText": "\u00c2\u00a7112 (r) (7).  These regulations require facilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to develop an RMPlan.  The goal of an RMPlan is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts on the public.  \nThe chemical currently used in the water process at this site that is covered by the regulation is chlorine.  The maximum potential amount of chlorine to be present on site at any one time is 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine is stored in one ton cylinders, and although there is a potential for 8,000 pounds to be present on the site at any one time, typically, at least 2 of the cylinders are empty, usually leaving less than 4,000 pounds on site at a given time.\nThe key to a successful risk management program is to first define hazard and undertake a comprehensive approach to prevention.  The Center for Chemical Process Safety has defined hazard as:\nA chemical or physical condition that has the potential for causing damage to people, property or the environment.\nOnce hazards are identified on the site, then, an evaluation of the risk involved will lead to a systematic identification, evaluation, and control of potential losses that may arise in operation from future events such as fires, explosions, or toxic chemical releases.  The operations and prevention plan portions of this RMP sets forth inspections and maintenance requirements of equipment, employees training and periodically reviewing readiness.  Throughout this RMPlan, the emergency readiness procedures and regular training schedules are emphasized.  One of the goals of implementing these procedures and schedules is to minimize the chance of a release occurring.  If the plant employees practice preventive maintenance and are well trained in emergency procedures, if a release occurs, they will be successful in preventing and minimizing personnel injury.\nAll employees at the Smiths Wat"

      "SummaryText": "er Treatment Plant are required to know the locations of the emergency telephone numbers and names of individuals to contact in case of a release.  If an emergency occurs, each employee will have an assigned task.  The RMPlan details which individuals will respond to the release to stop it and outlines the agencies that will be responsible for evacuating the appropriate areas, and for sounding the \u00c2\u00bfall clear\u00c2\u00bf once the leak is contained.  The plan also includes procedures for the periodic review of readiness.\nNo major or minor releases have occurred at the Smiths Water Treatment Plant to date.  One goal of this RMPlan is to maintain the plant\u00c2\u00bfs current safety record.\nThis plan includes the following sections:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProgram Requirements\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHazard Assessment\n\u00c2\u00bf\t Emergency Response \n\u00c2\u00bf\tPrevention Plan\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAudits\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), Tier 2 reports, employee training certificates and release confirmation and report forms will be maintained as part of this document.\nThe Smiths Water and Sewer Authority Water Treatment plant is taking steps to reduce long range risks associated with the operation of the plant.  Currently plans are being developed for the design, construction, and implementation of on-site disinfection generation system at the Smiths Water Treatment Plant.  The equipment for this process passes a salt and water (brine) solution through and electrolytic cell producing chlorine for disinfection.  This system would replace the chlorine gas system that is currently being used at the Treatment Plant.  Replacing the chlorine gas system will eliminate the possibility of a chlorine gas release and the associated risks involved with chlorine gas.  The onsite generation system is expected to be put into service by 2012."
