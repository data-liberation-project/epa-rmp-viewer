Executive Summary \n\n\n\nCalpine is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for their workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, Calpine has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all its employees and operations.  Calpine believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. \n\n\n\nAs part of this commitment, Calpine has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Calpine and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs\" (the RMP rule) and Delaware's Accidental Release Prevention Regulation.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at Calpine.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Calpine.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at Calpine consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substance"

In fact, Calpine has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing various levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries/damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nCalpine limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at Calpine, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of Calpine's RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, Calpine considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect Calpine workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\nCalpine works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at Calpine, the equipment is designed, built, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\n\n\n\nCalpine limits damage from a release, if such a release were to occur.  Calpine trains workers to react quickly in the event of an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release were to occur.  In addition, Calpine works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.  Calpine has installed devices (monitors, deluge system, dike) to minimize any impact in the unlikely event of a release.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at Calpine consists of a number of elements, only some of which a"

This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Calpine that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCalpine is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Calpine implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Calpine; and programs to evaluate the hazards at Calpine.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Calpine established a management system headed by the Power Complex's EHS Specialist to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Calpine and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Hay Road Energy Center is a power generation facility designed to supply power during high electrical demand periods.  In order to support these operations, Calpine handles regulated substances (Anhydrous Ammonia) in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess                     Program              Regulated                      Maximum       Largest\n\n                                  Level                   Substance                     Process        Single\n\n                                                                                                    Quantity        Vessel\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia          3                Anhydrous Ammonia     56,000 lbs     56,000 lbs\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analyses\n\n\n\nCalpine performed an analysis of the potential offsite consequence for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could have on the public or the environment.

However in accordance with the RMP requirements, a worst case release analysis was conducted and the results are reported in this document. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated are intended to represent releases that might occur. The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) improve community emergency response plans.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Calpine's and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  While Calpine believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at the Hay Road facility, Calpine has evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nCalpine has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document and RMP*Comp that was developed to provide the highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such a release. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The model was developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nWhile the model provides the required data to meet regulatory requirements, it does not provide detailed information on the travel time or concentration of the chemical in the plume.  Typical information input to the model to characterize a chemical release are:\n\n\n\n* Physical State:  gas, liquid, aerosol, and multi-phased\n\n* Release Type:  continuous, instantaneous, point (stack releases), and area (releases from a pool)\n\n* Release Condition:  height, substrate type (concrete, soil), area and height of curbing, exit velocity, release diamete"

Meteorological data are used in dispersion models to calculate the distance that the pollutant plume moves downwind and the concentration of the pollutant at any given time or distance.  The meteorological variables that affect the dispersion of a chemical release are as follows:\n\n\n\n* Wind Speed and Direction: The wind speed is used to determine the plume dilution, plume transport, plume rise, evaporation rate, and magnitude of the concentration.  Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\n\n* Temperature:  Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\n\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\n\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence.  The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects.  Turbulence also acts to dilute the plume and reduce down wind concentrations.  \n\n\n\nFor the RMP modeling performed the following meteorological parameters were used for the two scenarios:\n\n\n\nworst case release scenario:\n\n\n\n* Wind Speed:  1.5 meters/second\n\n* Stability:    F\n\n* Temperature:  77 deg.

The recommended response to a release is to shelter-in-place and to shut off any air intakes (e.g., air conditioners or fresh air make-up systems).\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Calpine.  These requirements are:\n\n\n\n* One worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process (the Hay Road Energy Center does not have any processes meeting the Program 1 definition)\n\n* One worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)  \n\n* One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e. one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 2 and Program 3 processes (the Hay Road Energy Center does not have any process chemicals meeting the flammable substance definition)\n\n\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Calpine. \n\n\n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a 12,000 gal (56,000 pound at the maximum fill capacity of 85% or 10,200 gal)) Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank in the Anhydrous Ammonia System.

In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established Program 2 and Program 3 prevention requirements, Calpine has implemented the Program 3 prevention requirements, which are as follows:\n\n\n\nProgram 3  - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation, and is the most rigorous prevention program. It has been established for the Anhydrous Ammonia System.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of Calpine's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n\n\n1.4.1  Program 3 Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Hay Road Energy Center Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Anhydrous Ammonia System, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n1.

Operating procedures are updated at least annually to ensure they reflect current operating conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  Training: The Power Complex trains workers to perform their assigned tasks safely and effectively. The Calpine training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews, written tests and on-the-job training are used to verify that an employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.\n\n\n\nThe operators are consulted annually during operating procedure reviews to evaluate the effectiveness and need for additional training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n5.  Mechanical Integrity:  Calpine maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\n\n\n6.

Calpine compared potential use of both Anhydrous and Aqueous Ammonia and determined that Anhydrous Ammonia was more appropriate to minimize the potential for serious incident or off-site impact due to the following:\n\n\n\n* decrease in the number of ammonia deliveries to the site; therefore less truck traffic;\n\n* decrease in the number of ammonia delivery truck hook-ups and disconnects which historically has been when the majority of all Ammonia releases occur; \n\n* decrease in the number of failure points (i.e., valves, pumps, flanges, etc.); and \n\n* decrease in the likelihood of corrosion to the system due to the nature of Anhydrous Ammonia, use of double wall piping, use of corrosion protection for underground piping.\n\n\n\nIn order to ensure the integrity of the system, the process is located almost entirely within the containment area, which further reduces the risk of release.  The storage tank is engineered specifically for Anhydrous Ammonia service.  The piping is double-contained, wrapped with co"

The process uses an advanced control system with emergency shutdowns to ensure safe operation.   Detectors and alarms located around the tank, injection skids, and Heat Recovery Steam Generator provide continuous monitoring for Ammonia in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nCalpine is required to complete a review of the covered process for incidents occurring in the five-year period prior to the submittal date for the regulation. There were no EPA reportable incidents in the last five year period.\n\n\n\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nCalpine has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Calpine does not have \"First Responder\" capabilities.  Calpine's response will be to notify the LEPC and other off-site emergency response personnel in the event of serious incident or off-site impact.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n\n\n* informing the LEPC about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences.\n\n* clear identification of communication, roles and responsibilities during an emergency event.\n\n* reviewing and updating the emergency response plan.\n\n \n\nAll Calpine personnel are trained in Shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures.  Calpine periodically coordinates emergency response drills.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has been communicated to local emergency response officials and local fire departments.  Calpine maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire officials and provides response information, as appropriate. The county emergency response team was on site for training "

The original HAZOP study provided design changes that are being incorporated into the final system design and construction.  Calpine will continue to review and improve the safety of the Anhydrous Ammonia System.\n\n"
