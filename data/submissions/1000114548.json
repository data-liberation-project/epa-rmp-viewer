Our focus is on keeping employees away from dangerous areas, while the mechanical equipment and contract emergency services control the chemical release. When an employee observes a release, he/she shall secure the area if possible, immediately notify the inside plant operator, make sure the inside operator notifies one of the emergency coordinators, and leave the area.\nThere has been no accidental releases of controlled substances within the last five years.\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety, however our program is under constant review for ways to improve safety and if any planned changes come out of said reviews it will be added to the RMP executive summary or they would be noted in the MOC (Management of Change) records."
