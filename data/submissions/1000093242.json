The same\n\nproperties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to\n\nprevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and\n\ncontractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to\n\nadhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia,\n\nPennsylvania. AmeriGas also has nine Regional Logistics Managers, a Director of Terminals, a Regulatory Compliance Manager\n\nand a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able\n\nto immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the\n\nscene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all afterhours\n\nand emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas\n\nfield personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to AmeriGas retail facilities and wholesale customers. Propane\n\nis received by rail cars then distributed to the customers by truck transports. Access to the site is restricted to authorized\n\nemployees, management personnel and contractors by the use of perimeter fencing and controlled gate access.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nThe si"

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility\n\nas required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.\n\nThe integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through\n\nperiodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion\n\nhazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting\n\nprograms.\n\n\n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, emergency shutdown systems and portable fire extinguishers are also\n\navailable on site. The emergency shutdown systems include the ability to activate via remote control, positive shutoff valves\n\ndesigned to shutdown the affected equipment or isolate a problem once it is detected.\n\n\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling\n\nhazardous chemicals. In addition, the site complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal,\n\nstate and local codes. When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.\n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers are trained in the terminal's loading & emergency action plan procedures and future plans\n\ninclude driver certification using the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\n\nOff site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario\n\n\n\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario.

Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \"For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, \n\ntaking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\" is the worst-case Scenario.\n\n\n\nThe greatest amount of propane held is 30,000 Gallons or 110,000 lbs. The total quantity released \n\nwas 110,000 lbs. The propane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas \n\nof sufficient congestion and confinement and result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nUsing EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst-case distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumption\n\nRMP assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability \n\nclass F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient \n\nair temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes \n\na yield factor of 10 percent.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was chosen. The active \n\nmitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the \n\nhose. The calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\n\n\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps \n\nand Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that \n\nwould mitigate the risks of release from pumps and compressors.
