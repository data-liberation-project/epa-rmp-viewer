      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to meet the requirements of Section 112? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, codified in the Code of Federal Regulation Title 40 Part 68.\n\nStationary Source and Chemical of Concern\nSitka Sound Seafoods is located in Sitka, Alaska.  The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a larger seasonal workforce during the summer months.  The plant produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.   In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The plant has been operating safely since 1974.\n\nWorst-case Scenario\nA worst case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  The EPA specifies that this release be a failure of the largest vessel in the system, which is the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR).  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the CPR fails catastrophically, releasing its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  The release is modeled using RMP*Comp? software. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the facility prevention plan.  In this scenario, a forklift driver with mast elevated hits the 20 foot high piping bridge to the icehouse.  The impact causes liquid ammonia piping to crack resulting in a release to atmosphere.  As this section of the system is located outdoors, no mitigation is considered in the scenario calculations. The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented "

(EPA GAR), subsequent Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, May 2004, appendix to General Risk Management Program Guidance, April 2004, and verified with RMP*Comp? software.\n\nRelease Prevention Program \nSitka Sound Seafoods has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which is designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nSitka Sound Seafoods maintains a written emergency action plan as part of the PSM plan to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personn"
