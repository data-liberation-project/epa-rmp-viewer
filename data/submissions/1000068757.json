As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage employees have access to \n\nrelevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage facility is a commercial cold storage facility for fresh produce.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms.  Four (4) rooms are designated as \"precooling\" rooms, while three (3) others are cold storage rooms.  The precooling rooms are equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils and the storage rooms are equipped with ceiling suspended coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.   A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n\n\nThe storage rooms utilize a pumped liquid recirculator system where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to a liquid recirculator through a liquid feed solenoid valve and an expansion valve.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to two reciprocating and two screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is li"

Excess liquid from the liquid recirculator is pumped to a transfer vessel where the liquid transfers into the high pressure receiver by gravity.  The system uses hot ammonia gas to defrost the coils.  A portion of the high pressure discharge from the compressors is piped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve and into the coil.  There are two high pressure receivers, however, they are piped together so that they act in concert. \n\n\n\nThe precooler rooms utilize a gravity flooded system where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to the precooler rooms, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessels mounted behind the bunker wall.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the bunker coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the gas to the compressors in the engine room.\n\n\n\nThe facility was built in 1994 by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. \n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACC"

      "SummaryText": "IDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nSunmet Packing & Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSunmet Packing & Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nSunmet Packing & Cold Storage's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nSunmet Packing & Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sunmet Packing & Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation."
