The facility produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The facility system has recently undergone extensive remodeling, which brings it over the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nA worst case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the catastrophic failure of a vessel in the system results in the release of its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  The release is modeled using RMP*Comp? software. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the facility prevention plan, and in the facility?s five year accident history.  In this scenario, a plate freezer hose develops a leak, releasing ammonia to the atmosphere.  Mitigation by the building is considered in the scenario calculations as the release occurs indoors.  The release is modeled with RMP*Comp? software.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program \n\nTrident Seafoods has implemented a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is design"

      "SummaryText": "ed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has built in safety features including high level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, and leak detectors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no incidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Trident Seafoods North Cordova facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.119 to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel."
