Lyons has identified potential process hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) refrigeration systems and has developed a program to prevent and reduce the risk that these hazards pose to employees and/or the public.  The process hazard analysis was based on an International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) hazard study customized and supplemented with unique site-specific issues to ensure that all potential hazards of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at Lyons were thoroughly identified and evaluated.  Lyons has taken care in the design, operation, and maintenance of all anhydrous ammonia containing equipment to ensure a high level of safety.  ",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nLyons Magnus East (hereafter referred to as Lyons) complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68), OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR ?1910.119), and OSHA's Emergency Action Plan Standard (29 CFR ?1910.38).  The Lyons Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of a highly hazardous material - anhydrous ammonia (CAS number 7664-41-7).  Through our compliance with Part 68 and 29 CFR ?1910 we promote overall plant, worker, and community safety.  Lyons RMP enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequence of a significant release of ammonia including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\n\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental release of anhydrous ammonia that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, Lyons is policy is to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Lyons has developed a formal RMP incompliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  Employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  The Lyons facility's Risk Management System clearly defines line of authority and designation of responsibilities to ensure that the RMPs are developed, implemented, and revised.  Lyons safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern the ammonia refrigeration process, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility and Regulated Chemical Description \n\n\n\nLyons is a beverage food processing facility located at 95 Richmond Road in Walton, KY 41094.  The facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (112(r)) of"

Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than the 10,000 pound threshold as established in the regulations.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  Preparation of the food beverage products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep products fresh.  The system consists of compressors, evaporators, piping and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  The ammonia may exist as either a gas or a liquid in different parts of the system.\n\n\n\n3.    Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA worse-case release scenario (WCRS) and alternate-case release scenario (ACRS) were developed.\n\n\n\n4.    Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nLyons complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rules and OSHA's standards under 29 CFR ?1910 for anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration systems meet EPA RMP Rule and OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR ?1910.119) and has been audited to the requirements every 3 years.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was most recently updated for the ammonia refrigeration system using a \"What-If Checklist\" technique and all identified problems were addressed.  Written Operating Procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with the ammonia refrigeration system have been trained on operating procedures and understand the process consequences of deviation from the procedures.  Written maintenance procedures are in place.  A written Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) compliant with current RAGAGEP is in place for the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in off-site impacts of any kind.\n\n\n\n6."

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLyons currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration system at this time.  However, the processes will be subjected to periodic Process Hazard Analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Lyons personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes.\n\n\n\n"
