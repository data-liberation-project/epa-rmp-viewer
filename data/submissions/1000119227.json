A copy of the RMP filed with the EPA containing the required RMP information is available in Appendix 5.\nExecutive Summary - Bells Run Station\nErgon Midstream (Ergon), owner and operator of the Bells Run Station, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the investment in accident prevention. Ergon is committed to training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. Ergon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Bells Run Station is a central delivery point for stabilized condensate from nearby areas via pipeline and truck. A 5K stabilizer skid is used to process unstabilized condensate from nearby areas via truck and send the stabilized condensate to atmospheric tank storage. NGLs are extracted from the unstabilized condensate and sent to an NGL bullet tank on site. Process gas is sent to a Flash Gas Compressor. Stabilized condensate is stored in six atmospheric tanks and is loaded on barges. Extracted NGLs from the Stabilizer unit are trucked offsite.\nThe heat and material balance provided for the Bells Run Station shows that the stabilized condensate stored within six atmospheric tanks has a boiling point above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, the stabilized condensate is classified as a NFPA-3 flammable mixture and is not subject to 40 CFR Part 68. However, future testing could indicate that the stabilized condensate could be considered a NFPA-4 flammable mixture. As a result, Ergon has chosen to include stabilized condensate in the inventory of regulated substa"

The facility contains two sources of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture and Pentane.\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\nProcesses at the Bells Run Station are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 3 (RMP) regulation. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\nEmployee Participation\nErgon encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\nProcess Safety Information\nErgon keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For the process, the facility has documented safety-re"

The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\nThe Bells Run Station also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and the electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nErgon has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nErgon primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution per Ergon's Risk Management Protocol. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a re"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Bells Run Station periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the station, or at minimum every five years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\nOperating Procedures\nThe Bells Run Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\nIn addition, the Bells Run Station maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Bells"

      "SummaryText": "Run Station has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\nContractors\nThe Bells Run Station uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Ergon has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nErgon conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\nErgon has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use"

The Bells Run Station incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\nSafe Work Practices\nErgon has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected\npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\nManagement of Change\nErgon has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\nIncident Investigation\nErgon prompt"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Ergon periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted on a periodic basis. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\nThe processes at the Bells Run Station have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\nUniversal Prevention Activities\nThe accident prevention program summarized previousl"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\nThe overall emergency response program for the Bells Run Station is coordinated with the Washington County LEPC. Mr. Rich Hays is the contact for the Emergency Management Agency for the Washington County and can be reached at (740) 373-5613. The Bells Run Station has around-the-clock communications capability. Ergon operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Newport Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Ergon conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Bells Run Station provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substance in the facility.\nFive - Year Accident History\nThe Bells Run Station has not had any accidents as of the date of this RMP. Therefore, the facility has no accident history.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Bells Run Station resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.\nRecord Keeping\nThe owner or operator of the Bells Run Station should maintain this documentation supporting the implementation of the RMP for five years (40 CFR part 68)."
