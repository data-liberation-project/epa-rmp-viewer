Airgas National Welders implements many Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the propylene process and the storage process for chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Along with written standard operating procedures, several administrative controls and safe handling of compressed gas cylinders are used to prevent any accidental releases.  These include, operator training, emergency procedures, qualification of operators, and inventory control.  \n\n\n\nThe company uses a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as the foundation of the chemical prevention program. The PHA systematically examines the equipment, systems and procedures for handling regulated materials in order to identify the hazards that exist and how to control them. The \"HAZOP\" methodology was used to identify the hazards associated with the filling and handling of propylene cylinders and the \"What-If\" methodology was used in evaluating the hazards associated with the storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders. Included in the reviews were, if applicable, previous incidents, verification of controls and the consequences of their failure, review of issues related to sitting and human factors and a qualitative evaluation of failures of control.  \n\n\n\nImplementation of PSM/RMP produced improvements to the process. Refer to PSM/RMP corrective action log. At this time there are no additional changes planned.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAirgas National Welders has a written Emergency Action Plan that is site specific as well as an Emergency Response Plan to be implemented in case of an accident, release or spill of a hazardous material.  The EAP is a separate document. Airgas National Welders Emergency Response Plan consists of a trained hazardous material response team in accordance with the company's Emergency Response"
