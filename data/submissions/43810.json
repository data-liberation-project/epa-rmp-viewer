If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Knoxville Fire Department (Station #18) and the Knox County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad and the University of Tennessee Medical Center (Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center) via 911.  This facility currently maintains trained incipient fire response and hazardous material first responder- operations level, technician level, and incident command  personnel to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Knoxville Terminal is a refined petroleum product storage and transfer facility including storage, pipelines and truck loading racks, in addition to the butane blending system (truck and railcar offloading and storage; actual blending occurs off-site).  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system only including two 60,000 gallon (water capacity) storage tanks, railcar storage incidental to offloading (up to eight cars capacity) and associated piping.\n\nThe facility's worst case scenerio is the failure of one of the butane blending system's 60,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed by system controls (85%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.   The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site to a distance of 0.5 miles and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate scenerio (based on probability and severity of an occurance) is a pullaway incident resulting in a one minute pipe/LP hose release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site and could effect the adjacent railw"

      "SummaryText": "ay.\n\nThe Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals- Knoxville Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D- Program Level 3) and as referenced by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Risk Management Program.  Additionally, this Plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor- Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for highly hazardous chemicals (29 CFR Part 119), the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.  This butane system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for liquified petroleum gas.\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving the butane system (new system) which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Knoxville Terminal butane system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Knoxville Fire Department (Stantion #18) and request their assistance.  The facility maintains a trained incipient fire and hazardous material response group, as referenced above.  The facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Knoxville Fire Department and the Knox County LEPC.  The Knoxville Fire Department is aware of the facility's butane system and available fire suppresion systems."
