General accidental release and prevention policy of Ryan Foods.\n\nAt Ryan Foods processing facility we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant during our dairy\nproduct manufacturing process.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant\nalso makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to\nour workers, the surrounding community and the environment.  \nIt is our policy at Ryan Foods to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program\nby managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state\nregulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release\nof hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant\npersonnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices\nthat are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nRyan Foods, 100 East Chestnut Street, Murray, Kentucky, operates a refrigeration system\nutilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a\nthermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to\nmaintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of\nevaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are\ndesigned to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and\nexpansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle\nis a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent h"

The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a\ndesired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area where it is of no\nconsequence.\n\nRyan Foods facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain processing, storage room and product\ntank temperatures required for the processing and storage of our product. There are\napproximately 250 employees at this facility, including hourly and salary personnel. They\nmanufacture and prepare shipment of refrigerated dairy products via truck approximately 24\nhours a day, seven days a week.\n  \nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not\nlimited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n \n\n\n\nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n3. Worst case  and alternate case release scenarios including administrative and\nengineering controls to limit/ prevent accidental release.\n\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR)\nlocated inside the machine room.  This vessels normal operating level approximately 50% of it's\ntotal capacity. Engineering controls which limit the liquid level to a maximum of 80% at any time.\nConsidering the \"catastrophic\" possibility does exist for this vessel to release it's entire contents, engineering "

      "SummaryText": "controls incorporated into the system would normally\nprevent such a release.\n\nAlternate release scenario is represented by the release of ammonia vapor from a safety relief\nvalve (SRV) due to an over-pressurization condition on the accumulator vessel located within the\nmachine room. The indicated relief valve would be performing exactly as it is designed to do\nduring an over-pressurization condition. Valve would open to relieve the over-pressure and vent\ninto the atmosphere via the roof vent pipe.\n\n\n     The following administrative and engineering controls are in place at Ryan Foods.\nThese controls are designed to eliminate, or reduce the possibilities of an accidental release\nfrom the refrigeration system.\n\n     *  Electronic ammonia detection installed in compressor room, upper and lower coolers. \nAlarm system activates a local audible alarm to alert plant personnel of the potential ammonia leak\nin the monitored areas. \n     *  High liquid level switches are configured to accumulators. High level switches will shut\ndown associated compressor operation during a high level condition.\n     * All compressors are configured with critical safety controls (high pressure, low pressure,\nhigh oil temp cut-outs, etc.) to shut down the respective compressor in the event of an abnormal\noperating condition.\n     *  Safety Relief Valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and compressor\noil separators to eliminate over pressurization conditions in those associated pieces of equipment.\n     *  Periodic Maintenance Program is contracted through a reputable refrigeration company\nto ensure the refrigeration system and it's components are kept in optimum mechanical and\noperating status. Weekly inspections are conducted by the refrigeration contractor. Daily rounds\nare made by plant personnel to verify proper equipment operation.\n\n4.
