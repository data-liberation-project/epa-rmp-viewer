      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBlock 31 Plant\n\nThe  Block 31 Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Block 31 gas plant is located west of Crane, Texas. The plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.\n\nThe Block 31 plant handles gas produced from the Block 31 field. Produced gas is processed to remove natural gas liquids (NGLs), then reinjected into the reservoir for pressure maintenance, used for fuel, or sold.\n\nGas comes into the plant at pressures ranging from 10 psig to 175 psig. Gas must be at 1200 psig for processing; therefore, compression is required for streams coming into the plant at lower pressures. Any liquid that drops out from the gas during compression is returned to the field and combined with the oil production.\n\nAfter inlet compression, the gas is split into two streams. A small amount of gas bypasses straight to injection, and the largest part flows to the Nitrogen Rejection Facility (NRF) for processing. \n\nNitrogen Rejection Facility (NRF)\nDiglycolamine (DGA) is used to sweeten, or remove CO2 and H2S from, the gas stream that flows through the NRF. The rich DGA is regenerated by reducing the pressure and then heating the amine to remove any light hydrocarbons, CO2, and H2S. Steam provides the heat needed for this regeneration. The hydrocarbon gases driven off are returned to the plant inlet gas system. The acid gases CO2 and H2S are compressed and injected. The lean DGA returns to the amine contacto"

      "SummaryText": "rs to sweeten more gas.\n\nNRF feed gas is dehydrated after the sweetening. Triethylene glycol absorbs water and a small amount of light hydrocarbon from the gas. After contacting the gas, the rich glycol is heated and flows into a flash tank where light hydrocarbons vaporize. These light hydrocarbons are returned to the plant inlet system. Water and remaining hydrocarbon gases are removed from the glycol in the glycol reboiler, which is heated by steam. The water and hydrocarbon vent gases are condensed to recover liquids and return the remaining vapor back to our inlets system. The lean glycol returns to the glycol contactors to continue the process.\n\nThe gas must be free of all water, CO2, and H2S before entering the cryogenic process. Mol sieve beds are used to remove any remaining water, CO2, and H2S. Two beds are in service while two beds are being regenerated. Beds are regenerated using heated nitrogen that flows countercurrent to the process flow. Regeneration gas is cooled and reinjected into the reservoir. Regeneration gas heaters burn sweet residue gas.\n\nThe sweetened, dehydrated gas flows through the cryogenic process for removal of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons. The gas is chilled to very low temperatures using a single stage turbo expansion process. The liquids removed are stored in a pressurized tank and pumped into pipelines for sales.\n\nThe remaining gas is a mixture of methane and nitrogen. These are separated in the nitrogen rejection unit(s) (NRU?s). The NRU?s chill the gas to condense methane from nitrogen. The nitrogen is vented or injected, and the methane is vaporized and used for plant fuel or sold.\n\nAuxiliary Systems\nSteam is the heat source for many units at Block 31. Steam is produced in two boilers. Each boiler by itself is capable of producing the entire plant?s steam requirements. Both are operated in the event an upset occurs with one, there is no downtime in getting steam from the other unit. The boilers burn sweet residue gas.\n\nThe f"

The pilot stream is sweet residue gas.\n\nAn open drain system in the plant carries fluids to sumps scattered throughout the plant. From the sumps, the fluids are pumped into five pits. Oil collected in these pits is routed to the oil-water separator, then pumped to the oil production facility. Water ends up in the waste water tank before injection into a disposal well.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Block 31 Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Block 31 Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration inf"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Block 31 Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the  process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Block 31 Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have oper"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Block 31 Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the  Block 31 Plant  has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conduced at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe  Block 31 Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of "

In addition, the  Block 31 Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Block 31 Plant  conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements be properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Block 31 Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1)  conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Block 31 Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Block 31 Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Block 31 Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
