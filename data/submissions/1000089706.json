      "SummaryText": "Grammer Logistics, Inc. - Apopka Trans-Load Facility is a butane railcar storage and transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane railcar storage and transloading system (Program Level III) including storage of up to five (5) butane railcars and approximately two 2) transloading units.\n\n\n\nThe Grammer Logistics, Inc. - Apopka Trans-Load Facility complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119). This butane railcar storage and transloading system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nThis is an RMP for a new facility and therefore has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Grammer Logistics, Inc. - Apopka Trans-Load Facility butane railcar storage and transloading system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Apopka Fire Department and request their assistance. The facility personnel are trained. Facility emergency response is coordinated with the fire department and Orange County Office of Emergency Management and/or LEPC. The primary hazardous materials response capabilities are provided by the Apopka Fire Department.\n\n\n\nImprovement actions to be considered primarily focus on site security and rail safety measures including continuing safety audits and safety inspections."
