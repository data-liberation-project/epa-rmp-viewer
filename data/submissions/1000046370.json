All applicable prevention procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program will be adhered to.  The City of Groton's PSM program and emergency preparedness plan, including an emergency contingency plan and an oil spill prevention control and countermeasure plan, involve preparation, evacuation and notification procedures and coordination of emergency response with the Southeastern Connecticut Emergency Response Task Force and the local fire department.\n\nGroton Utility's water treatment plant (WTP) was originally built in 1939, with plant improvements from 1950 through 1990, upgrading the plant capacity from 2 to 12 millilon gallons per day.  The Groton WTP is located at 1268 Poquonnock Road, Groton, Connecticut.  The WTP contains a chlorine building consisting of a chlorine storage room, which contains liquid chlorine ton cylinders, and a chlorinator room, which mixes the chlorine with finished water at a rate of 2 ppm and regulates the flow of chlorine to various stages of the treatment process.  Groton's treatment plant is equipped with safety equipment and controls, including continuous chlorine monitoring for leak detection and a scrubber system for the chlorine building.  Within the storage room, two one-ton cylinders are on-line and up to six one-ton cylinders may be in reserve.  The system is also equipped to detect a loss of vacuum in the feed system.  \n\nThe City of Groton WTP's safety systems for the chlorine building include constant chlorine monitoring for leak detection, a scrubber to handle major leaks, respirators and repair kits for minor incidents, and an alarm system identifying a loss of vacuum in the chlorine injection system.  The scrubber is designed to handle a complete cylinde"

Specifically, storage of chlorine cylinders has been reduced from a maximum of 8 cylinders in reserve to a maximum of 6 cylinders in reserve.  Additionally, replacing empty cylinders and receiving deliveries of cylinders has been restricted to the hours of 8 am to 4 pm, during which adequate WTP staff are available to supervise and conduct these activities. \n\nThe general City of Groton's emergency contingency plan and PSM program for an accidental release are based on training of operators, implementation orf preventive maintenance, auditing and inspection programs, continual review and upgrade of process and safety equipment, use of accurate and effective operating procedures (developed with the participation of the operators), and execution of periodic hazard reviews of equipment and procedures.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Groton WTP in the past five years.\n\nThe water treatment plant has coordinated its emergency response procedures with the City of Groton Poquonnock Bridge Fire Department and Southeastern Connecticut Emergency Response Task Force.  The fire department has been designated as first responder for any emergency involving a chlorine spill or leak.  Procedures have been developed for the effective and timely notification of response personnel and the community and for the safe evacuation of employees."
