PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.  Additionally, PSC has determined that, despite qualification for Program 2 compliance, it is prudent to establish and maintain Program 3 compliance as a conservative safety and business approach.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nRifle Gas Plant is a 50 mmscf/day natural gas dewatering and liquid hydrocarbon extraction facility constructed as a joint project between PSC and Rocky Mountain Natural Gas (division of KN Energy);  the plant is operated by PSC.  The RMP-regulated substances handled at this facility are liquid hydrocarbon product, propane, and natural gas.  The hydrocarbon product is extracted from the natural gas processed at the plant;  propane is used for process cooling.  There are four 30,000 gallon liquid hydrocarbon product storage tanks (607,200 pounds) and one 1000 gallon propane tank (5060 pounds).\n\nThe gas processin"

The initial RMP audit was conducted in September 2001 and all changes recommended by the audit have been completed.\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Rifle Gas Plant RMP program, a process hazard analysis was conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation"

The balance of the facility is regulated under the DOT Pipeline Safety regulations Parts 190-199.\n\nThis is a remote, unmanned facility exempt from OSHA PSM requirements.  However, three PSC operators perform periodic system checks and maintenance at the plant.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one 30,000 gallon tank or 151,800 pounds of hydrocarbon product) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  Reference Table 9 of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance (dated May 24, 1996) was used to determine the distance to overpressure of 1.0 psi for a vapor cloud explosion of hydrocarbon product.  A distance of 0.431 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined for a release of 151,800 pounds in ten minutes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrocarbon product consists of a release of 6915 pounds of hydrocarbon product over a one-hour period due to continued release (and potential failure open) from a 5/16 inch relief valve on the tank.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  The ALOHA air dispersion model was used to determine the volume of hydrocarbon product that would be released in sixty minutes, and Reference Table 9 of the RMP OCA Guidance was used to calculate the distance to overpressure of 1.0 psi.  A distance of 0.118 miles to the flammable endpoint was determine"
