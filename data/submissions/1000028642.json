      "SummaryText": "Elanco a division of Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), a global research-based pharmaceutical corporation, is a world leader in developing products and services that enhance animal health, wellness and performance.  Elanco manufactures animal health products at its Clinton Laboratories facility (Clinton Laboratories).  Clinton Laboratories is located approximately five miles north of Clinton, Indiana.  Operations at Clinton Laboratories began in June of 1970.  Clinton Laboratories is located on a 700-acre site.  The plant itself includes 70 buildings on 200 acres.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Clinton Laboratories has designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\r\n4. Five-year accident history\r\n5. The emergency response program\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\n\r\nClinton Laboratories is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous chemicals. Clinton Laboratories has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Elanco uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. Clinton Laboratories, accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\nClinton Laboratories has a Plant Emergency Response Plan that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification o"

A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\r\n\r\nClinton Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues. Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\n\r\nClinton Laboratories is divided into two main functional areas.  Animal Health manufacturing, on the south end of the plant, manufactures feed additives and other animal health products.  These products are finished and packaged on site for worldwide delivery to customers.  The second functional area, site services, is located primarily in the center of the plant, with other buildings throughout the plant. Services provided include: steam, water, heat transfer media, electricity, and maintenance support. The services area provides support for Animal Health areas.  The facility has a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\r\n\r\nThe following regulated substances are handled at Clinton Laboratories in quantities above the threshold quantities established under the RMP regulations: \r\n\r\nTOXICS:  anhydrous ammoni"

It includes elements such as:   site emergency response plan, employee protective actions, the emergency management organization, and implementation of a response, post incident procedures and building specific pre-emergency plans.  The plan is executed through a cooperative effort between the site's management support team, full time emergency response teams, local law enforcement, and local emergency management. The on-site emergency response capabilities include full time emergency response teams (described below), fire and spill response equipment, rescue apparatus, ambulance service, and clinic. Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS \r\nSite emergency response team members participate in frequent training conducted both internally and externally. In an emergency situation, a member of the plant security staff fulfills the incident commander role. The Incident Commander directs all field response activities and makes regular reports to the management support team as the incident proceeds.  The Incident Commander and Incident Team Leaders direct the specific tactical actions of the emergency response teams, described below.  Approximately 70 employees, who hold full time jobs elsewhere on the site, make up the various emergency response teams.  Most of the employees are cross-trained on more than one team.  A brief description of the teams follows.\r\n\r\nFIRE BRIGADE/HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HAZMAT) TEAM\r\nThis is a combined team of both fire fighting and hazardous material spill response.\r\nThe fire brigade is a structural fire fighting organization trained to respond to industrial fires.
