One notable exception is ethylene oxide, which can create hazards due to polymerization. \n\n\n\nAll four chemicals have many common safeguards. There are some additional safeguards with the EO and PO Bulk Storage systems. These processes utilize a scrubber as a process control and utilize an excess flow control device for railcar unloading.
