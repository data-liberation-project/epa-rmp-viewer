Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nCRI Recycling Service, Inc. uses a high-pressure solvent extraction process to clean used oil absorbent materials.  The CBI Flammable Substance extracts both polar and non-polar liquids from the absorbents.  In this oil absorbent recycling facility, we use a CBI Flammable Substance, which is considered hazardous for flammability by the EPA. The same properties that make the CBI Flammable Substance valuable as an extracting solvent also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the CBI Flammable Substance combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we have implemented and in the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA, EPA and NFPA Programs, such as the Process Safety Management (PSM), Process Hazard Analysis, and an Accident Workplace and Injury Reduction Program (AWAIR) for this type of CBI Flammable Substance.  Our emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to clean and reuse oil absorbent material.  The CBI Flammable Substance is used to extract the contaminants from the oil absorbent material.  The Recycle/Recovery and Storage processes were added increase the efficiency and safety at CRI Recycling Service, Inc.  The CBI Flammable Substance is delivered in bulk tanks and transferred into a 6,565 gallon bulk storage tank."

      "SummaryText": "Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe maximum amount of the CBI Flammable Substance that can be stored at this plant is 31,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst-case scenario. Failure of the storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 31,000 pounds of the CBI Flammable Substance. Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 85% at 70\u00b0F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source:\r\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario is 0.20 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative scenario.  Failure of the 1-inch supply pipe due to accidental rupture would release approximately 5,200 pounds of the CBI Flammable Substance after 10 minutes.  An excess flow valve installed on the supply pipe is designed to stop a release if the pipe is broken, this valve would have to fail, with an accidental rupture, for the release to happen.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source:\r\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the alternative scenario is 0.10 miles.\r\n\r\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nThis recycling  facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of our operators have been thoroughly trained using in-house training programs.\r\n\r\n5. Five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nNo reportable accidents in the previous 5 years.\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program.\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA, EPA, and NFPA Standards.   The Police Department, F"
