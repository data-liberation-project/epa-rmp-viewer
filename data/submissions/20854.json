Several alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1 opening in a high pressure liquid line.  Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  These scenarios presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 12,000 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.6 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line, and would encompass a population of 4 with the closest residence approximately 1 mile from the site and a school about 1 mile away, outside of this release zone.  A hospital is outside of this release zone.    No other public or environmental receptors are located within this zone.   Populations and distances to offsite receptors such as schools, hospitals, and residences are based on 1990 Census data contained in LandView III.\n\nThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than ten minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves. \n\n 1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCSI complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).

Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of CSI to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by 29 CFR 1919.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\u00b7 CSI stores and distributes refrigerated and non-refrigerated foods.   Storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\u00b7 The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\u00b7 The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.
