ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbides Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation, UCAR Emulsion Systems, located in Torrance, California, operates a latex emulsion manufacturing facility that produces more than 100 million pounds of latex per year.  The water-borne latex produced at this site is utilized by the coatings industry to make latex-based paints, caulks, adhesives and sealants.  The facility is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of regulated substances listed in the RMP rule.  The UCAR Emulsion Systems Torrance facility does not maintain specified quantities of any RMP regulated flammable substances, but does utilize the following RMP regulated toxic substances at levels above threshold limits: \n\n7 Acrylonitrile (2-Propenenitrile)\n7 Vinyl Acetate (Acetic Acid ethenyl ester)\n\n3.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no cred"

      "SummaryText": "it was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios. \n\n3A.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the toxic substances at the facility is a failure of the acrylonitrile storage tank, resulting in an instantaneous release of 67,600 pounds of acrylonitrile.  The acrylonitrile liquid is released into a 40 foot by 20 foot dike, which acts as passive mitigation for the release. According to EPAs Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  Credit for administrative controls was not taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nSpecific systems to prevent this scenario from occurring, as well as mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\nHydrocarbon Gas Detector and Alarm Systems:  This system is designed to detect toxic vapor releases and to automatically activate alarm systems to alert operations personnel of a possible emergency situation.\n\nSprinkler Deluge System (water spray):  This system is designed to mitigate and suppress toxic vapor clouds from migrating from the facility boundaries.\n\nInventory Restriction:   Written operating procedures, which include an operating checklist, and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 84%.  A high level alarm would sound if the tank were filled to 84% capacity.  At this point, procedures require operations to stop all transfers into the tank.  An additional high-high level alarm is set at 90%, which would automatically stop all transfers into the tank when the volume reaches this level.\n\nReaction Prevention:  Systems in place to ensure reactivity of material stored in tanks is inhibited.\n\nPressure Relief Systems:  Pressure relief systems help to ensure that over-pressures within tanks are mitigated.\n\nOperator Certification:  Only trained and certified Union Carbide employees are permitted to unload Acrylonitrile into the"

ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAcrylonitrile:  The alternative case scenario for acrylonitrile assumes an open >\" drain valve on the discharge side of a pump while transferring acrylonitrile to an intermediate mix tank.  This scenario leads to an 800 pound release of acrylonitrile in 2 minutes, the time it would take to complete the entire transfer from the storage tank to the intermediate mix tank. The scenario assumes that the release is contained in spill containment trenching and enclosure, which mitigates the release.  Although active mitigation measures do exist if this scenario were to occur, no active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  According to EPAs Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\n\nSpecific systems to prevent this scenario from occurring, as well as mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\nAutomated Containment Systems:  A system is in place to automatically pump any releases in this spill containment area to a closed storage tank.  This would mitigate the release of toxic material into the atmosphere.\n\nEmergency Shutdown Systems:  A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the pumps and put the transfer valves in a fail-safe position.  \n\nHydrocarbon Gas Detector and Alarm Systems:  This system is designed to detect toxic vapor releases and to automatically activate alarm systems to alert operations personnel of a possible emergency situation.\n\nSprinkler Deluge System (water spray):  This system is designed to mitigate and suppress toxic vapor clouds from migrating from the facility boundaries.\n\nSurveillance:  Operations personnel routinely monitor the process and facility perimeters.\n\nVinyl Acetate:  The alternati"

Operational Safety Standards\n\nDesign requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards.\n\n4L.  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nUnion Carbide conducts reviews just prior to startup to ensure that new and modified facilities and processes are safe for operation. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n4M.  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nUnion Carbide has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) if needed to prevent their occurrence.\n\nUnion Carbide primarily uses the What-If/Checklist analysis as well as Fault Tree Analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. These analyses are recognized as some of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. \n\n4N.  Process Safety Information\n\nUnion Carbide keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.
