THIS COMPANY IS A FULL SERVICE FARM SUPPLY COMPANY WITH THE GREATEST RISK OF RELEASE COMING FROM OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANKS. THIS FACILITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE 120000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION MEASURES WE UTILIZE RANGE FROM EMPLOYEE TRAINING TO EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE. WE HAVE EXCESS FLOW VALVES, BACK CHECK VALVES, AND PRESSURE RELIEF VALVES ON OUR AMMONIA SYSTEM. WE ALSO HAVE GUAGES TO TELL US WHEN THESE TANKS ARE FULL TO PREVENT THE OVER FILLING OF THESE TANKS WHICH IN TURN WOULD CREATE AN ACCINDETAL RELEASE. WE INSPECT OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE REVIEW OUR SAFETY POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN CONSISTS OF NOTIFYING THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS THE LEPC IF A RELEASE OCCURS. THE NUMBERS TO CALL ARE 911 AND 515-961-6386 RESPECTIVELY. OUR ROLE AS THE COMPANY WILL BE TO SECURE THE AREA UNTIL LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARRIVE AND ASSIST THEM IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. THIS IS OUR PLAN IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD HAPPEN."
