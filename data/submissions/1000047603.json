      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nDavis Supply is a supplier of water treatment chemicals for small, local, public and private water treatment facilities. The Marion County facility is located at 2300 Northeast Eighth Avenue in Ocala, Florida [29.209523? North latitude and 82.128229? West longitude]. A site location map is included as Figure 1 at the end of the executive summary. This office/ warehouse facility includes a chlorine storage area within the warehouse area, which contains 150-pound cylinders of chlorine chained against the eastern wall of the facility. Empty cylinders are stored adjacent to the full cylinders in the same area. A maximum inventory level of 36 cylinders or 5,400 pounds of chlorine gas will be stored on site at any time. A site drawing is included at the end of the executive summary as Figure 2. Based on the maximum inventory levels, only chlorine will be subject to the RMP standard. Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release. This facility does not fall into any of the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes as listed in the RMP standard. As a primarily retail business (i.e. selling to end users) with less than 10 full time employees on site, this facility does not meet the requirements for regulation under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard. This facility therefore qualifies as a Program 2 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\n\n\n\nIt is anticipated that no more than three (3) people will be employed by the facility at any time. In addition to 2 drivers, there will one (1) office manager. The facility is generally staffed by 1 person during the normal business hours of 0800 hours to 1700 hours, Monday through Friday.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine- related release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternative release.\" The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, \"the owner or ope"

The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\n\n\n(1.) The worst-case release scenario at this Davis Supply facility involves the release of the contents of a single 150-pound chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes. An offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed based on calculations provided by the EPA's Risk\n\nManagement Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis and\n\n\n\nthe EPA's RMP*Comp. This scenario followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\n\n\n\nThese conditions were set by the EPA to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; and the assumptions do not likely reflect realistic results. The toxic endpoint based on EPA assumptions was estimated to be to be 0.4 miles. The population within the entire 0.5 square mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a radius of 0.4 miles for this scenario was estimated to          be 41 people. Figure 3 depicts the worst-case scenario 0.4-mile toxic  endpoint potential impact area with a smaller plume shown to the North to depict the prevailing wind the majority of the year and, therefore, most likely impact direction. Public receptors within the area contained in a circle with its center at the Davis Supply facility and outwards at a radius of 0.4 miles were noted as follows:\n\n\n\nPublic, Non-Residential Receptors\n\nMarion Christian Academy (0.2 mi S) 1800 NE 8th Road [20 child day school ages 8-17]\n\nOak Crest Elementary (0.4 mi NE) 1112 NE 28th Street [560 child elementary school]\n\nKids Academy (0.3 mi NE) 2514 NE 12th Court [91 child day school ages 6 m"

The alternative release scenario involves valve failure on a single 150- pound cylinder. From the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release, the release rate for the valve of a 1- ton container of chlorine is 12.7 pounds per minute. The only difference between the valve of a 1-ton container and 150-pound cylinder is the presence of a fusible plug on the 1-ton container. The release rates therefore would be expected to be the same. Based on the calculations as\n\nprovided by the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite\n\nConsequence Analysis and the EPA's RMP*Comp, toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario was estimated to be 0.1 miles. Figure 4 depicts the alternative release scenario 0.1-mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a smaller plume shown to the North to depict the most likely impact direction. The population within the entire 0.03 square mile toxic endpoint potential impact area with a radius of 0.1 miles for this scenario was estimated to be 3 people.
