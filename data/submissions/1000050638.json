      "SummaryText": "I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA.  BACKGROUND\n\nThe United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments in November 1990.  Section 112R of the Act requires facilities to implement measures to prevent accidental releases of contaminants into the atmosphere and to minimize the consequences of any release. These amendments were a part of a continuing effort to prevent accidental releases of toxic chemicals and minimize damage to human health and the environment.\n\nThe Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prepare a list of substances with their toxic threshold, and develop rules for a risk management program. It required a facility to identify hazards from potential releases, design and maintain a safe facility, and minimize the consequences of a release:\n\nIn response, the Environmental Protection Agency completed the following actions:\n??A?    provided a proposed list of substances on January 19, 1993\n??A?    published the proposed Risk Management Rule on October 20, 1993\n??A?    promulgated the Risk Management Rule on June 20, 1996; and\n??A?    required development and implementation of a Risk Management Program.\n\nThe Risk Management Rule requires all applicable facilities to prepare a Risk Management Program (RM Program) by June 21, 1999 and implement it on an on-going basis. The Risk Management Program includes:\n??A?    registration of the facility with the EPA\n??A?    completion of a hazard assessment of the facility\n??A?    development of a prevention plan to reduce the probability of releases\n??A?    development of a response plan for implementation in the event of a release, and\n??A?    submission of a summary of the RM Program (the Risk Management Plan) to the EPA\n\nB.  APPLICABILITY\n\nThe City of Durant??A?s Water Treatment Plant (WTP) utilizes numerous chemicals in order to supply a safe (free of bacteria) and reliable source of potable water to the citizens of Durant.  Of those chemicals, only chlorine is utilized in a process in quantities greater than the threshold qu"

      "SummaryText": "antity defined in the regulations. \n\nChlorine is used to disinfect our water and make it safe to drink. At the Durant WTP, chlorine is delivered and stored in cylinders with each container holding a net weight of one-ton or 2000 pounds.  In accordance with our standard operating procedures, no more than five (5) one-ton cylinders are on site at any time. Thus the maximum quantity of chlorine utilized or stored at the site at any one time is 10,000 pounds.  This exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds for chlorine; therefore, the requirements of the Risk Management Rule are applicable to the Durant WTP.\n\n\nC.  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe City of Durant desires to protect the public health by providing a safe water supply in sufficient quantities to meet fire protection needs and satisfy the demands of the users of our water distribution system. We must strive to maintain a balance between the risks associated with chlorine use and the risks associated with consuming contaminated water.  The benefits of providing a pathogen-free water supply exceed the risks associated with chlorine usage in a properly operated WTP.\n\nIt is important to understand that chlorine may present a hazard to the public health if utilized in an uncontrolled manner. Chlorine and numerous other chemicals exhibit acute toxicity at certain levels of exposure.  The probability of experiencing toxic levels of exposure at a properly operated WTP is small. However, the consequence of exposure to toxic levels of chlorine is extreme and can result in loss of life. \n\nSince chlorine is used in our disinfection process, the goal of the RM Program is to provide a management system that reduces the risk of injury or death (to our employees and to the public) as a result of an accidental release of this chemical. We can manage the risks associated with the use of chlorine by taking a proactive approach to its use. \n\nThe City of Durant WTP RM Program includes a Prevention Program and an Emergency Response "

The plan includes public notification procedures, first aid and emergency medical treatment procedures for chlorine exposure, and the responsibilities of the emergency response entities\n??A?    includes procedures for using, inspecting, testing and maintaining emergency response equipment\n??A?    sets forth procedures for review and update of the emergency response plan to keep it current\n\n\nD.  RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nSeveral release scenarios for toxic substances were considered during the hazard assessment phase of the RM Program. The regulations require evaluation of the facility??A?s accident history for the past five years as well as an assessment of the impact of a worst case release scenario and a more realistic alternative scenario.  Release scenarios are evaluated using EPA RMP*Comp Version 1.07 software which makes the following assumptions: \n\n??A?    Toxic Endpoint: The toxic endpoint for chlorine of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 parts per million (ppm) is utilized.  This value is corresponds with the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level of concern 2 (ERPG-2) which is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which all individuals could be exposed for one hour without experiencing health effects that could impair"

Alternately, the toxic endpoint for chlorine at the level of concern ERPG-3 is 20 ppm; this is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which all individuals could be exposed for one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.  Thus the toxic endpoint is conservative.\n??A?    Weather Conditions: Ambient temperature and the temperature of the chemical is 77&#730;F.\n??A?    Location: Release occurs at a WTP located in an urban setting; and the release occurs outdoors.\n??A?    Mitigation: Active or passive mitigating devices were not considered. An example of a passive mitigating device would be the containment of the release provided by the chlorine room.  An example of an active mitigating device might be the use of air scrubbers to neutralize the chlorine prior to release.\n??A?    Wind Speed: The wind speed is assumed to be 3.4 miles per hour for the worst case release scenario while wind speed is assumed to be 6.7 miles per hour for the alternative release scenario.\n??A?    Atmospheric Stability: The atmospheric stability is assumed to be Class F (very light wind, late night, and partial cloud cover) for the worst case release scenario while the atmospheric stability is assumed to be Class D (moderate wind speed, and completely overcast skies) for the alternative release scenario.\n\n5-Year Accident History Review\n\nThe City of Durant WTP has not had a reportable release of a toxic substance. The reportable release quantity for chlorine is 10 pounds.  The only releases noted during the 5-year time period are those associated with replacement of the chlorine cylinders.  During cylinder change out, a small quantity of chlorine gas remaining in the flexible tubing between the cylinder and the piping manifold can be discharged.  In all instances, the chlorine gas is retained inside the chlorine room where it is dispersed.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe regulations require an assessment of the impact of a worst"

The worst case release scenario for the Durant WTP assumes the release of the entire contents of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder in a ten-minute period. Thus, the release rate is 200 pounds per minute for a ten-minute duration period. An example of how this release might occur is damage to the cylinder during unloading at the WTP.\n\nUsing EPA RMP*Comp Version 1.07 the toxic end point for the above chlorine release is 1.3 miles.  Thus, a circle with a radius of 1.3 miles is drawn around the WTP to account for any possible wind direction. Under this scenario, approximately 3,000 persons in residential structures have a potential to experience a concentration below which all individuals could be exposed for one hour without experiencing health effects that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nAlternative More Realistic Scenario\n\nThe regulations require an assessment of at least one alternative release scenario.  Staff reviewed historic release data and developed several release scenarios that have a more probable, realistic chance of occurring at the WTP.  Plant personnel can effectively handle these release scenarios. However, none of these scenarios caused an off-site release of chlorine. Thus, another set of alternative scenarios were developed. \n\n* Alternative More Realistic Scenario: It was assumed that the entire contents of the 1-ton chlorine cylinder were released as a liquid through the 5/16-inch diameter opening in cylinder valve.  This could occur if a heavy object was dropped shearing the valve. The release rate is 241 pounds of liquid chlorine per minute for a duration period of about 8.3 minutes. Using the EPA RMP*Comp Version 1.07 the toxic end point the release is 0.3 miles.  Thus, a circle with a radius of 0.3 miles is drawn around the WTP to account for any possible wind direction.

The alternative release scenario could impact persons working or traveling within a 0.3-mile radius of the WTP.  In the event of an off-site release, WTP staff will immediately contact emergency response teams from the Durant Fire department, and the Bryan County Emergency Management. \n\nThe scenarios are documented in Attachment IV-5.\n\n\n\n \n\n"
