      "SummaryText": "The Andersons, Inc.\n\nWalton Wholesale and Retail Farm Center\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n\n\nSource and Product Description\n\nThe Andersons Walton facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular). This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since the end of 1989. The manager is Mark Erny and the operations supervisor is Matt Vianco.  Site management names and emergency contact information are posted on a sign at the facility entrance.\n\n\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 40 acres and is situated two miles south of the intersection of State Route 218 and US35, on the southern edge of the town of Galveston.  The town of Walton is located north of the facility.\n\n\n\nWalton manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 40,000 tons of polyphosphate fertilizer per year.  Walton also produces a fertilizer solution called aqua ammonia, which is made by combining water and anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nOne of the RMP-regulated materials involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia.  Three 30,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 76,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\n\n\nThe other RMP-regulated material at this facility is aqua ammonia. The facility manufactures aqua ammonia for resale to the farmers.  Aqua ammonia is a solution containing anhydrous ammonia and water.  Two one-million gallon tanks, one ? million gallon tank, two 56,000 gallo"

      "SummaryText": "n tanks and six 30,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of the aqua ammonia. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous and aqua ammonia are not poisons, but they are an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are non-flammable gases.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and, therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\n\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\n\nThe principal causes of ammonia and propane emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck or railcar) to the bulk storage tanks.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\n\n\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or loading stations occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow. \n\n\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\n\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n\n?  Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standa"

If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n\n?  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\n?  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n\n?  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\n?  An emergency shutoff cord, located along the unloading station shuts the plumbing off. There are also four remotely located electrically controlled pneumatic valves that can be activated to shut off all the outlet valves of the storage tanks\n\n?  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and an adjacent water well at each unloa"

All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia.  All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files.  Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\n\n\nThis facility uses a certified contractor for all certified welding and construction performed on the tank.

Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nAll contractors receive a \"contractor safety review\" prior to performing work at the facility.
