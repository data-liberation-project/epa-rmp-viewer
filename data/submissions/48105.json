Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at Twin City Foods in the past five years.\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Program\n\nTwin City Foods has a written Emergency Response Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of WISHA Emergency Response regulations, WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Stanwood Fire Department.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Twin City Foods and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\u00bf Incident Command Center\n\u00bf Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n\u00bf Emergency Response Team\n\u00bf Evacuation Plans and Assembly Points\n\u00bf Personal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Stanwood Fire Department, including the Snohomish County HAZMAT Response Team.  \n\nAll Twin City Foods personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and ident"

      "SummaryText": "1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Twin City Foods refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Twin City Foods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\u00bf Twin City Foods is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\u00bf The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s"

      "SummaryText": "), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView 5 (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTwin City Foods complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\nThe Twin City Foods written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed as required and updated as necessary by the Twin City Foods PSM Committee. \n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).
