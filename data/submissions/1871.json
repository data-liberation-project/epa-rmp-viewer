New additions to the refrigeration system are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., pipes placed near ceilings, tanks placed away from forklift and truck traffic). \n\n2.2  Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\n24,400 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained on site at Tampa Maid Foods.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs. \n\n2.3   Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n2.3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe vertical ammonia inter-cooler storage tank in the center of the engine room contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a day to day basis.  This tank typically holds approximately 11,500 lbs. of ammonia when 100% full under an internal pressure and temperature of 15.7 psi and 0 0F.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe dispersion models Degadis, Tscreen, and Screen3 predict, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, the release may travel as far as 3.0 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 32,000 people, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that lie within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in Appendix C. \n\n\n2.3.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario for Tampa Maid Foods was selected to involve a cooling unit supply line, in the freezer, severed by a forklift truck during loading"

Ammonia (at 40 psi and 0 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate of 680 lbs./min from two-phase (gas/liquid) choked flow equations (Tscreen dispersion model).  It is estimated that the supply line could be isolated in approximately 10 minutes, with a corresponding total quantity in the supply line released of approximately 1350 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  Air dispersion models used, predict, with a wind speed of 5 mph, the ammonia release, under these conditions may travel approximately 0.8 miles.  Approximately 3,600 people reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that are located within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in Appendix C. \n\n2.4  Accidental release prevention program ('68.155(d)).\n\nTampa Maid Foods standard policy requires daily inspection of the ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR  guidelines.  Necessary repairs to the refrigeration system are made in a prompt, safe manner.\n\n2.5  5 year accidental history ('68.155(e)).\n\nNo releases or accidents, involving anhydrous ammonia, that are reportable in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP Rule), have occurred at this facility.\n\n2.6  Emergency response program ('68.155(f)).\n\nEmergency Response:  During normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Lakeland Fire Department.  Maintenance and technical personnel have received hazardous material technician level training in accordance with OSHA 29CFR 1910.120(q)(iii).  Supervisory personnel have received incident commander level training in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(v).
