These policies can be found in the Process Safety Management Program and in the Business Plan. Emergency response procedures are in place and are presented to new hires as well as annual training for all employees.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHL Power is a 35 MW waste wood fired power plant, which uses Anhydrous Ammonia for emission control, Propane and Natural gas for start-up and supplemental firing, and Chlorine, which is used in water treatment in the cooling tower and fire pond.\n\nMaximum tank sizes are 17,638 gallons for ammonia and 18,328 gallons for propane. Administrative policies reduce these limits to 85% of tank maximums. The formula for calculating poundage from gallons is; specific gravity * 8.33 = pound per gallon. Anhydrous ammonia has a specific gravity of 0.62, 0.62 * 8.33 = 5.16 pounds per gallon. Propane has a specific gravity of .5074, .5074 * 8.33 = 4.23 pounds per gallon.\n\nThe maximum quantities stored for these four (4) regulated substances are as follows:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia       85% of 17,638 = 14,992 gallons * 5.16 = 77,359 pounds\n\nPropane                           85% of 18,328 = 15,579 gallons * 4.23 = 65,899 pounds\n\nChlorine                           3,000 pounds\n\nNatural Gas (Methane)   2,121 feet of 6\" Pipeline\n WORST-CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (RMP*Comp)\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst Case Scenario: Tank is struck by a vehicle, which causes a catastrophic release of all contents of the tank. All contents are released in 10 minutes. Release rate is 7,735.9 pounds per minute. Toxic end point is 4.9 miles.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Alternative Case Scenario: Fire on adjacent Propane tank causes the pressure in the Ammonia tank to increase. This increase in pressure causes the tank relief va"

Distance to toxic endpoint: 0.4 miles.\n\nChlorine Worst Case Scenario: Welded seam fails releasing all contents of tank. All contents are released in 10 minutes. Rate of release: 200 pounds per minute. Distance to toxic endpoint: 3.0 miles.\n\nChlorine Alternative Case Scenario: Regulator on end of cylinder blows out of tank leaving a 1-inch square hole. Rate of release: 123 pounds per minute. Distance to toxic endpoint: 0.5 miles.\n\nNatural Gas (Methane) Worst Case scenario: Truck impacts pipeline, which results in a vapor cloud explosion. Quantity released: 10,000 pounds. Distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.2 miles.\n\nNatural Gas (Methane) Alternative Case scenario: Flange gasket fails, which results in a vapor cloud fire. Rate of release: 500 pounds per minute. Distance to Lower Flammability Limit: 0.1 miles.\n\nPropane Worst Case Scenario: Catastrophic tank failure causes a release of all contents of the tank, which results in a vapor cloud explosion. Distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.3 miles.\n\nPropane Alternative Case Scenario: Delivery truck impacts tank causing a 3-inch square hole in tank which ignites (vapor cloud fire). Rate of release: 332 pounds per minute. Distance to Lower Flammability Limit: 0.1 miles.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nHL Power Company has administrative procedures in place to prevent overfilling of the Ammonia and Propane tanks. An offloading procedure has been developed to prevent releases during the filling of these tanks, and also one for unloading & replacing Chlorine cylinders. Plant speed limits are in place and enforced. A remote camera that is controlled from the control room is used to monitor offloading operations. All personnel receive training for all tasks involving these chemicals. Emergency procedures can be found in the Business Plan. Training information "

Training material can also be found in the Certification Training Program.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidents involving three of the regulated substances since 1988 when the plant was built. The Natural gas pipeline was completed in 1998, with no accidents to date.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHL Power Company Emergency Response Program is contained in the Business Plan. This plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed. It is also distributed to all agencies as directed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nHL Power Company has a system for communication with the employees on matters relating to occupational safety and health which include:\n\nThe labor/management Safety Committee meets monthly to discuss safety items. Employees are encouraged to discuss safety and health hazards with committee members. Committee members then bring this up for discussion at the monthly meeting.  Communication is kept anonymous if requested by the employee.\n\nWeekly Safety Meetings addressing safety related items including new product training, refresher training on required subjects and discussion of Safety Committee recommendations.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to inform their supervisors of any unsafe condition(s) as soon as it is identified. No Company reprisal will be taken.  This is covered in the New Hire Orientation. Unsafe conditions may be presented to management at any time."
