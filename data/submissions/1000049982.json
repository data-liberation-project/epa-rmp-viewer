The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the Atchison County AGChoice Anhydrous Plant in Fairfax are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Fairfax Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry fertilizer, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. \n\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. There was a reportable release on April 16, 2015 and the report is included.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has;\n\n\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\n       b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency  planning and\n\n           community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III \n\n           (EPCRA);\n\n\n\n       c"
