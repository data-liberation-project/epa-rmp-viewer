The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include but are not limited to a comprehensive & Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is an integrated approach to Accidental Release Prevention & the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the goal of the company to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.\n\n\n\nA \"Non Responding Facility\" policy has been adopted; however the Company recognizes the need to be prepared to safely deal with emergencies. A Hazardous Material Business Plan consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements has been developed and includes emergency procedures, requirements, and information necessary to notify public response agencies and technical resources; the Staff communicate to the Fire Department and evacuate (or shelter-in-place) if there is a release situation or fire. Managers and employees would also shepherd visitors (truck drivers receiving product or delivering product). By effectiv"

The WPS Oxnard regional office is within ? mile of the site. WPS supports HAZWOPER 1910.120 (q) and Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians (RETA) training for key Refrigerating Technicians and management personnel. These personnel are available to support Oxnard Fire/CUPA and the facility in the event of an emergency, and staff are on-call 24/7/365. Written procedures that include ammonia specific emergency pre-planning have been developed within the WPS \"Thirty Minute Plan\". Ammonia-specific emergency equipment is maintained in WPS Refrigerating Technician's service vehicles. The company strives to execute its accidental release prevention & emergency response policies through appropriately skilled employees that are provided with adequate equipment and training.\n\n\n\nA relationship with Oxnard Fire/CUPA has been established. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated via regular site visits/inspections and submittal of appropriate EPCRA and other compliance reports. Compliance reports and submittals are updated in accordance with applicable requirements at predetermined intervals. Oxnard Fire/CUPA has also participated with WPS in the execution of Process Hazard Analysis at this and other facilities in the Oxnard area. The WPS/Mountain View Division facility has confirmed that it is included in the Oxnard Community Emergency Plan, and key management personnel have received Incident Command System (ICS) training.\n\n\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe WPS/Mt.

Facility building space occupies approximately 102,000 square feet on a 5.5 acre lot; 67,636 square feet is devoted to refrigerated warehouse space. The refrigeration process is a state-of-the-art system engineered and installed according to the current codes and standards adopted locally by the City of Oxnard. Cutting-edge safety controls are engineered directly into the plant including but not limited to the Ammonia Control, Monitoring, Detection and Alarm System; and new Fire Suppression System including sprinkled building space. The Mountain View Division is 100% owned by Western Precooling Systems. The Mountain View Division manages pre-cooling and refrigerated storage; Western Precooling Systems supervises & maintains the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested fruit (pre-cooling strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries) and then subsequent short-term refrigerated storage prior to shipping. The berries are on site generally from 1-4 days from harvesting depending on market demand. The facility is seasonally operated with product harvest periods picking up in the month of November and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Major maintenance is performed in the off-season. Operational maintenance is performed on a year-round basis. Company policy requires appropriately pre-qualified personnel to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a single closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Refrigeration equipment consists of Compressors, Condensers, Vessels, Pumps, Mobile and Stationary Pressure Cooling Units, Room Evaporators, piping and an Ammonia-water Diffusion System.

The elements of the PSM Program are intended to be integrated with the ongoing functions of the facility. The program is specifically intended to prevent an occurrence and minimize the consequences of an Anhydrous Ammonia release. In California the PSM program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189, which is integrated with the Cal/ARP and Fed/ARP Accidental Release Prevention Programs.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures have been developed for the daily operation of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release. The written procedures include necessary safety precautions and address each operating phase as defined by the Cal-ARP RMP/PSM Program.

The Written Operating Procedures are maintained on-site and regularly validated.\n\n\n\nScheduled inspections and maintenance are executed by Western Precooling Systems (WPS) qualified technicians and/or pre-qualified specialty vendors.

Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility has installed these types of valves at each of the system's oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther ammonia-specific release prevention steps:\n\n-Pressure relief valves are piped to a common header that terminates at the bottom of an Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank.\n\n-A computer monitoring system that monitors process parameters 24/7/365.
