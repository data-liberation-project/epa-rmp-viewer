      "SummaryText": "The Compton Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Branson, Missouri, has been in\r\n\r\noperation since 1988. It is designed to treat 5.3 million gallons of wastewater per day. The facility is \r\n\r\nlocated next to Lake Taneycomo on approximately 4 acres of land that is equal or lower in elevation than \r\n\r\nthe surrounding terrain. The plant is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by experienced, certified \r\n\r\noperators, under the direction of an Operations Supervisor. A lab and office building occupy the site along \r\n\r\nwith an equipment building, a sludge thickener building, 4 oxidation basins, 4 clarifiers, chlorine basins and \r\n\r\nsand filters, 2 waste sludge tanks, and 3 sludge holding basins. Chemical and biological nutrient removal \r\n\r\nsystems were added in 1995 to remove phosphorus and enhance the quality of the plant effluent.\r\n\r\n            Chemicals used on site are Potassium Permanganate, liquid Polymer, Liquid Alum, Chlorine, and \r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide. Each of these chemicals are potentially hazardous if not handled properly. Potassium \r\n\r\nPermanganate is metered into the waste sludge flow at a specified rate to reduce odors in the sludge \r\n\r\nholding basins. It is considered hazardous because of its ability to accelerate the burning of combustible \r\n\r\nmaterials and the irritating effects caused by its dust or mist. Gloves, respirators, and eye protection are \r\n\r\nused when handling this chemical. \r\n\r\n            A liquid polymer is used in the treatment process to dewater sludge as it passes over a gravity belt \r\n\r\nthickener. The polymer is mixed and aged and is then metered into the sludge flow to seperate solids \r\n\r\ncontained in water. The hazards of this chemical are minimal, but spilled material can be extremely slipperly. \r\n\r\n            During the final step of phosphorus removal, liquid alum is used to coagulate suspended solids in \r\n\r\nthe effluent, prior to filtration.  We receive liquid alum in bulk form. It is then stored in 3, 3000 g"

This chemical is \r\n\r\nconsidered hazardous because of its toxic fumes, low pH, and corrosive nature.\r\n\r\n            The remaining two chemicals are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Both of these chemicals are \r\n\r\nextremely hazardous in their gas or compressed liquid form if not handled properly. Employees who handle \r\n\r\nchlorine and sulfur dioxide are required to receive extensive training prior to working with either chemical \r\n\r\nand must be involved in continous training to stay up to date with safety practices. Chlorination is a safe \r\n\r\nand effective way to disinfect treated wastewater before it is discharged into a receiving stream. \r\n\r\nChlorine is shipped to the site in 1-ton gas cylinders. A vacuum system is used to remove the chlorine from \r\n\r\nthe cylinder at a specified rate. Should the system fail, causing loss of vacuum, regulators mounted \r\n\r\ndirectly to the cylinder valve will close to prevent any loss of chlorine into the atmosphere. After the \r\n\r\nchlorine has had sufficient time to disinfect the effluent waters sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the \r\n\r\nplant effluent just before it enters Lake Taneycomo. Sulfur dioxide is shipped to the plant in 150 lb \r\n\r\ncylinders. The same type vacuum system used in chlorination is also used to feed sulfur dioxide.   \r\n\r\n            As of June 21, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency requires that all facilities which store \r\n\r\nand use chemicals such as chlorine in quantities greater than 2500 pounds, to establish a risk management \r\n\r\nprogram. The Risk Management Program for the Compton Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant includes an Action Plan that will be put into effect in the event of a hazardous chemical release. This \r\n\r\nplan provides guidelines to assure that hazardous material (HAZMAT) emergencies are handled in a \r\n\r\nmanner consisent with current regulations and safety practices.

Although a small spill or leak does not entail the same complex \r\n\r\nresponse mechanism as a massive release, it still has the potential to produce localized injury or \r\n\r\ndamage. The intent of this plan is to assure that all plant personnel approach every HAZMAT incident from \r\n\r\nan informed perspective. In this way, adequate precautions can be taken to minimize the degree of hazard \r\n\r\nto our employees and the public.\r\n\r\n              During a hazardous material emergency at the plant, a trained supervisor will take charge of \r\n\r\nresponse activities. The trained supervisor will first assess whether the release is considered emergency \r\n\r\nor incidental. Incidental releases will be handled by plant personel, while emergency releases will require a \r\n\r\nresponse by the Branson Fire Department.\r\n\r\n              The Compton Drive Action Plan details response activities of trained \r\n\r\nHAZMAT personnel and lines of communications and authority between responders from Police, Fire, and \r\n\r\nPublic Works departments. The plan also describes specific responsibilities of trained individuals, as \r\n\r\nwell as steps of mobilization, mitigation and types of safety equipment needed. Clean-up procedures and \r\n\r\nlevels of training to perform clean up are described. Also included are methods of accident prevention, \r\n\r\ninstructions for evaluation and follow-up meetings to review problems encountered during the response \r\n\r\nand ways to improve response time and communications in the event of a future incident. The  \r\n\r\nplan will be exercised as needed so procedures can be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\n               We believe this plan to be comprehensive, informative, and adequate."
