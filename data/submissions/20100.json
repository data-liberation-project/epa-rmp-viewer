This is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario release to toxic endpoint was determined using the RMP Comp guidance for anhydrous ammonia. The scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nVessel:                     Control Pressure Receiver\nAmount Released:     4,250 lbs\nDuration of release:    10 minutes\nRelease Rate:            425 lbs/mins\nWind Speed:              1.5 meters/sec\nAtmospheric stability:  F\nTopography:               Urban\nBased on RMPComp the toxic endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.30 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Case Scenario:\nThe alternative release case scenario release to toxic endpoint was determined using the RMP Comp guidance for anhydrous ammonia. The scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nScenario:                      Relief Valve failure on Pilot Receiver\nOrifice Size:                  1/2\"\nRelease Rate:               45 lbs/min\nDuration of Release:      10 minutes\nAmount Released:         450 lbs\nWind Speed:                 1.5 meters/sec\nAtmospheric stability:    F\nTopography:                 Urban\nBased on RMPComp the toxic endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.10 miles.\n\nRochester Meat Co. is implementing there PSM program to assure the ammonia system is ran in a safe and efficient manner. In implementing the PSM program Rochester Meat wil establish written operating porcedures and maintenance procedures to maintain the ammonia system. Also Rochester Meat will outline a training program to assure that all effected employees are properly trained on the ammonia system.
