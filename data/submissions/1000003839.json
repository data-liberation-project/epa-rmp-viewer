Olin has always had a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable.  Our goal is \"Zero\"  incidents.  To help insure that an emergency situation with off-site consequences will never arise, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place:\n\n. Employees\n. Mechanical Integrity\n. Process Hazard Reviews\n. Process Controls\n. Monitoring Systems\n. Emergency Response\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\nOur facility produces chlorine, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hypochlorite, using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. Olin/Augusta employs approximately 90 people, including engineers, operating and maintenance technicians, and administrative disciplines.  \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs such as PSM, including:\n\n Process safety information\n Process hazard analyses\n Operating procedures\n Training\n Mechanical integrity\n Management of change\n Pre-startup reviews\n Compliance audits\n Incident investigations\n Employee participation\n Hot work permits\n Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nChlorine containment tank to capture chlorine releases from chlorine system relief valves.\nChlorine monitors in the chlorine scrubber stack.\nChlorine recycle system for compressors.\nHydrochloric acid loading systems equipped with sh"

Corrective actions are taken to prevent reoccurance of these items.   \n\nFor these incidents, we conducted a formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause of these releases.\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
