Operating in a safe and environmentally protective manner are values held above all others.  Pasadena Plastics Complex is focused on preventing serious process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment.  The process safety management (PSM) program demonstrates this focused commitment.  The PSM program involves the application of management systems and performance management practices to control process hazards through objectives, programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  \n\n\n\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved, among other things, through the company's Employee Safety Process, Tenets of Operation guiding principles and S.A.F.E (Safety Awareness For Everyone) program.    Planned changes to improve safety at the Pasadena Plastics Complex are reviewed and adjusted annually. They are also included in the yearly budgets; and incorporated into the performance management systems / practice throughout the organization.  These planned changes include, but are not limited to safety related capital projects, safety programs / initiatives, procedure improvements, and SOP validations.   \n\n\n\nAdditionally, in the management systems and performance management practices used at the Pasadena Plastics Complex and are measured using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
