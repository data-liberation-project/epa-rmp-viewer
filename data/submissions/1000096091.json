The Facility Policy\r\n\r\n         The owners, management, and employees of Krown, Inc. dba Hi-Yield Products are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an\r\n         accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the \r\n         impact of the release to the people and the environment.
