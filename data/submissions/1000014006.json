The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0    Description of the Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  These substances are:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the wastewater prior to release into the receiving stream.\n* Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used to remove the chlorine from the treated wastewater before release into the receiving stream\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination proc"

The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant chlorination and sulfonation processes.  The following details the prevention program elements at the Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\nThe Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, including the chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\nThe Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the Conway Corporation Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the"
