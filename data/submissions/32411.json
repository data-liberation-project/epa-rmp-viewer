      "SummaryText": "The City of Gillette Environmental Services Water Division (COGWD) accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that uses available technology, procedures and management policies to meet requirements.  The COGWD emergency policy involves the preparation of response plans tailored to each facility and to the emergency response available within the community.  All applicable procedures of the EPA RMP are adhered  to.\n\n\nPump Station One (PS1) is a facility used to collect raw water from the wells located in and around the City of Gillette, disinfect the water and send it out into the distribution system.   PS1, for the purpose of RMP, consists of a chlorine storage room and a feed room.  These two rooms have their own entrances from the outside.  The rooms are aside of the main pump bay.  The pump bay holds the leak repair \"B\" Kit and the SCBA.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site at any one time is four one ton containers (8000 lbs.), while only two containers are on line at one time.  The feed room contains feed control valves and injection equipment.  PS1 is equiped with a computer control operating and alarming system.  Operators check the facility often.\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of the two chlorine release scenarios identified as \"worst case scenario\" (WCS), and \"alternative case scenario\" (ACS).  The first scenario is defined by the RMProgram states the \"the owner/operator shall assume the maximum quantity in the largest vessel if released as a gas over ten minutes\", due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative case scenario is defined as a \"more likely to occur leak than the WCS\".  OCA Guidance was used for modeling of this station.    \n\n\nLeak reduction, mitigation and control devices that we have in place are; written operating procedures, chlorine gas leak \ndetectors, emergency shutdown systems, and enclosed rooms for the chlorine containers and equipment.\n\n\nOur ACS would consist of a relief valve fai"

      "SummaryText": "lure.  The same mitigating systems would apply as for the WCS.  The chlorine gas detector would activate the emergency shutdown systems, closing the containers, and stopping the leak.  Water Operators would be alerted of the situation simultaneously.\n\n\nThe COGWD fashioned their accidental release prevention program after OSHA's PSM Program.  Our personnel have been trained in case of leaks by in house personnel and by the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Department.\n\n\nThe COGWD has not had an accidental chlorine gas release over the last ten years.\n\n\nThe COGWD's emergency response plans have been coordinated with the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Department and personnel have been trained by the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Department.  The COGWD personnel has Hazmat training, respiratory protection (SCBA) training, and the required first aid training.  Drills are conducted by the Campbell CountyLEPC/Fire Department with the COGWD personnel.  The rooms containing the chlorine containers and equipment do have leak detectors that are tied into the alarm system.\n\n\nPS 1 equipment has recently been updated to improve safety.  Training and drills will continue as usual.  The City of Gillette also has a safety committee that inspects all facilities periodically to ensure procedures are followed and hazards are not overlooked."
