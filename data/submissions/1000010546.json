Konoike-Pacific California, Inc.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nKonoike-Pacific California, Inc. has established a Risk Management Plan according to the EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) regulation for the Ammonia Refrigeration System to enhance its safety practices.  Konoike-Pacific California management is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and surrounding occupancies.  \n\nKonoike-Pacific California has an emergency action plan in effect to handle potential emergencies, including ammonia release, at this facility.  \n\nKonoike-Pacific California policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and OSHA PSM, i.e., anhydrous ammonia.  Konoike-Pacific California trains its employees to properly handle and store hazardous materials, to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  Konoike-Pacific California Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System at the Konoike-Pacific California facility is comprised of the ammonia receiver, intercooler, pumped accumulators, compressors, evaporative condenser, evaporators, glycol heater, emergency burner system, auto-purger, control units, instrumentation, valves and piping.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nKonoike-Pacific California has an RMP program in place to manage the handling of ammonia.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analy"
