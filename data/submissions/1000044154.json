The RMP/PSM manual includes the followng sections: 1.) Introduction- includes rolesand responsibilities among SNWS employees and an evaluation and rationale of why chlorine is the only RMP/PSM chemical at AMSWTF, 2.) Employee participation, 3.) Process safety information, 4.) Process hazard analysis- the last PHA was completed in December 2010, an another PHA shall commence in 2014, 5.) Operating procedures are reviewed annually and updated as needed, 6.) Trainings that includes HAZWOPER, PSM, PSSR, water treatment SOP, water treatment process, and various safety training are administered by different divisions within the organization, 7.) Contractors who work in the chlorination system are trained in RMP/PSM compliance and are keenly aware of chlorine hazard and safety rules, 8.) Pre-startup safety review was completed for an expanded chlorine facility at AMSWTF in 2009, 9.) Mechanical integrity had been performed by contractors but that responsibiity has been shifted to AMSWTF Treatment Division in 2009, 10.) Hot work permit- if possible, chlorine equipment are dismantled and taken to a mechanical shop in another building to perform hot work, 11.) Management of change is performed on replacement-in-kind and nonreplacement-in-kind modifications, 12.) Incident investigation is done for all leaks; whether they exceeded reportable quantity (RQ) or otherwise, 13.) Emergency response plan for chlorine is in a separate stand-alone binder, 14.) Compliance audit- the last self-audit of the AMSWTF chlorine system was completed in 2011, however, the State of Nevada CAPP Division conducts annual audit of the AMSWTF chlorination system, 15.) Trade secret does not apply to the chlorination system at AMSWTF.",

SNWS is the primary potable water supplier in southern Nevada.  The mission of SNWS is to \"provide reliable and quality water\" to the customers residing in southern Nevada.\n\n\n\nThe senior management team at SNWS is firmly committed to achieve a safe work place for the employees at the water treatment facilities by protecting their health and wellness while striving to eliminate exposures to highly hazardous chemicals. The goal of the SNWS senior management team is to achieve full compliance with the applicable federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, as well as the State of Nevada Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  \n\n\n\nOur commitment to total chemical safety is demonstrated through: \n\n1.) The employment of a full-time chemical engineer at the water treatment plant who is dedicated to evaluate and improve the water treatment processes, \n\n2.) A process safety engineer is assigned to SNWS to focus on the OSHA PSM, EPA RMP and Nevada CAPP compliance programs, \n\n3.) Implementing and improving the comprehensive PSM/RMP/CAPP programs to ensure the following are systematically evaluated and implemented: chlorine process design, process modifications, process technology, process hazard analysis, operational and maintenance activities, standard operating procedures and employee training, \n\n4.) Coordinating with the local emergency responders including the Clark County Fire Department and the National Park Service on emergency response program, \n\n5.)

Working with the State of Nevada OSHA office and State of Nevada CAPP Division on their audits/ inspections of the AMSWTF Chlorination System as part of the continuous improvement efforts.  \n\n\n\nSNWS has two water treatment facilities with a combined total maximum production capacity of 900 million gallons per day (MGD) potable water. Both are situated in remote locations and away from the densely populated areas of Clark County, Nevada. The AMSWTF is the larger of the two facilities and the only one that use chlorine as disinfectant in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is an OSHA PSM and EPA RMP covered chemical.   \n\n\n\nThe SNWS water treatment process starts by pumping raw water from Lake Mead into a contactor building to undergo ozone disinfection where ozone and oxygen gas mixture generated on-site are diffused, mixed and dissolved into water traveling through the contactor to achieve desired disinfection.  In the event the ozone generation system is down for maintenance, AMSWTF can use chlorine gas as a back-up disinfectant.  \n\n\n\nFollowing ozone disinfection, the ozonated water flows through a channel to the rapid mixers where a coagulant aid is added to combine the waterborne suspended particles.  Water then flows into multiple flocculation basins where the gentle mixing of water and coagulant aid causes the suspended particles to form larger clumps called \"floc\".  \n\n\n\nFrom the flocculation basins, water flows to the multi-media filters where the last step of physical polishing takes place.  As water passes through these filters, \"floc\" is trapped and collected and the filtered water passes through to the storage clearwell.  A corrosion inhibitor "

The finished water is now ready to be distributed to water users that include City of Boulder City, Clark County, City of Henderson, City of Las Vegas, City of North Las Vegas, and outlying areas.   \n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine is stored in trailers and shipped to AMSWTF by truck transport then kept in two enclosed buildings which have equipment to park the trailers and to evaporate the liquid chlorine for use as disinfectant.  Access to the two chlorine buildings is restricted to SNWS employees, authorized contractors, or visitors. AMSWTF also maintains an onsite meteorological monitoring station. The prevailing winds at AMSWTF are to the north-northwest; towards the Saddle Island cove and Lake Mead area.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine facility was designed and constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, and complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  \n\n\n\nTo ensure chemical safety, a multitude of technological steps have been incorporated into the AMSWTF chlorine system:\n\n\n\n1.) The entire process is housed inside two chlorine buildings and is monitored and controlled remotely by operators located in a separate control room, \n\n2.) Chlorine sensors are located inside the two chlorine buildings to continuously monitor chlorine level, \n\n3.) The same two buildings are kept under a slight vacuum, i.e., the pressure inside the building is slightly less than the outside ambient pressure; such a set-up minimizes chlorine leaking from inside the building to the outside, \n\n4.)
