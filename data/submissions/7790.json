      "SummaryText": "other organic material.  \n\nAs with most production processes, the activated carbon production process uses several different chemicals.  One of these chemicals is anhydrous ammonia, a chemical most commonly used on crops to provide nitrogen for plant growth.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless liquid or gas which is readily detectable by its extremely pungent odor.  In sufficient concentrations, anhydrous ammonia is an eye, skin, and/or inhalation irritant.  For this reason, anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard at 29 CFR Part 1910.119 and the EPA risk management rule at 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored in a diked above-ground  tank  with a nominal 12,000 gallon (62,040 lb) capacity.  For ammonia processes, the threshold quantity for coverage under 40 CFR Part 68 is 10,000 lb.  Figure 2-1 provides the layout of the Westvaco Chemical Division facility, with the storage area for the regulated process and the on-site transport route highlighted.  Once the tank truck is in the unloading area, Westvaco staff isolate the area from vehicular traffic and unlock the ammonia valves at the unloading station.  A Westvaco employee provides surveillance of the entire transfer operation from a safe distance.  Emergency shut-off valves can be activated remotely in the event of a spill or hose rupture. \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a significant release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect public receptors (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).

Program 3 related information is included in the Data Elements section of the RMPlan.\n\n3.0   RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate RMPlan's, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be utilized as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-case defined by the EPA methods and an alternative case, which is believed by Westvaco to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.  The actual incident history for this facility over the last five years has been reviewed.  No accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, emergency response, or damage to property or the environment\n\nHowever, to ensure that mitigation measures and emergency response plans are appropriate, potential release scenarios are considered.  Thus, the sections of the RMPlan which discuss both the worst case and the alternative case, believed to be somewhat mor"

The worst-case release scenario for the Westvaco Chemical Division facility is a gaseous release from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank dispersed under stable meteorological conditions (see section 3.1.1, below).  The worst case scenario involves a quantity of 10213 gallons (52,800 lb) of ammonia, which is less than the nominal size of the tank.  The ammonia storage tank is never filled to its capacity of 12,000 gallons. Administrative procedures and passive controls limit the quantity of ammonia in the tank. The standard operating procedure is to fill the tank to no more than approximately 85 % by volume, to allow for the volumetric expansion of ammonia.  A passive control device, which consists of a liquid return line to the delivery truck, prohibits filling the tank above 85% of capacity.  The quantity of ammonia to include in a worst-case release was identified by considering these administrative and passive controls. \n\n\n3.1.1 Dispersion Conditions\n\nMeteorologists have defined six atmospheric stability classes, A through F, each representing a decreasing degree of turbulence in the atmosphere.  The most turbulent condition is stability A, which is associated with light winds and very strong solar heating.  Stabilities B and C are characterized by progressively weaker solar heating and stronger winds.  Neutral or D stability occurs when winds are strong or when the sky is overcast.  At night the earth's surface cools, causing the lower atmosphere to stabilize and become less turbulent.  Stabi"

      "SummaryText": "lity E (moderately stable) corresponds to partly cloudy conditions with moderate winds.  Stability class F (very stable) represents a very low level of turbulence due to overnight radiational cooling and weak winds.   EPA requires that worst-case analyses be conducted using stability class F and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  Analysis of three years of meteorological data from the 10 m level of an instrumented tower at the Paducah, WSO Airport  indicates that these dispersion conditions occur about 13% of the time.\n\nTo describe aerodynamic surface roughness for modeling purposes, EPA has established roughness categories based on land-use type. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.  The Westvaco Carbon Plant and immediate vicinity are clearly urban in nature with areas comprised of large structures, while the area surrounding is more rural, containing small buildings, parking lots, and open land.  In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates, Westvaco has elected to model the worst-case and alternative release scenarios assuming 'rural' surface conditions. However, it should be noted that under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces located near the facility, and result in shorter distances to toxic endpoint.\n\n3.1.2 Interpretation\n\nThe risk management rule dictates that pressurized gases must be assumed to be released in the vapor state, regardless of whether an actual release would be in the gaseous or liquefied form.  Thus, while the dike under the anhydrous ammonia tank provides mitigation, it cannot be considered to have an effect on the worst-case release rate.  Hypothetical events that could result in a release of comparable magnitude as this worst-case release include a compl"

The dike would therefore substantially reduce the rate of release to the air and associated off-site migration.  The dike would also isolate a liquefied ammonia release from the sewer lines to the wastewater treatment system and serve to protect any nearby workers from the volatile liquid. The possibility of a worst-case type of scenario is extremely remote and virtually prohibited, given the design of the ammonia storage system and inspection and maintenance measures that Westvaco has taken as part of its accident prevention program.\n\nWorst-case analysis may overstate the hazard associated with an ammonia release.  Given that the worst case is a 10-minute release with a 10-minute averaging time, the extent of the emergency response planning zone is somewhat overes-timated because the toxic endpoint used to calculate a distance is appropriate to exposures up to an hour (see section 3.1.3). \n\n3.1.3 Modeling Method\n\nWorst-case dispersion modeling to determine the distance to toxic endpoint was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*COMP (Version 1.06) software.  RMP*COMP implements the consequence analysis calculations set forth in the EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG).  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.  As seen in Figure 3-1, the resulting emergency response planning zone is defined by a circle centered at the ammonia storage area with a radius equal to the distance to toxic endpoint of 4.4 miles (23230 ft.).

This level is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene As-sociation.  An ERPG-2 is the maximum airborne con-centration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects, or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  \n\nWithin the emergency planning zone for ammonia, the outdoor concentration at a stationary receptor, averaged over 10 minutes, could exceed 200 ppm.  Because this exposure level assumes a stationary receptor, it does not account for evasive or protective action.  Actions that could reduce or eliminate exposure to ammonia include avoiding the plume transport path, relocating beyond the planning zone, or seeking shelter in a building.\n\n3.1.4 Public and Environmental Receptors\n\nThe worst-case planning zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 2,200, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's LANDVIEW III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, which were supplemented with a local map of the Wickliffe area (DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).  The potential worst-case planning zone includes residential housing, public recreation areas and commercial areas.  There are no schools, hospitals, or prisons within the worst-case endpoint distance. The Peal Land Wildlife Management Area, which is located to the northwest of the Wickliffe facility, is the only environmental receptor identified. \n\nSince the resulting planning zone predicted for the worst-case toxic release potentially affects public receptors, the regulated process at the Westvaco Chemical Division facility is subject to Program 3 requirements."

However, the two facilities share information on hazardous chemicals and coordinate their emergency response plans.  Thus, the Westvaco Chemical Division facility has a program in place to notify the neighboring Fine Papers Division facility in the event of an accidental release.  Because it would not be necessary for the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) or other on-site emergency responders to coordinate intra-company emergency response, it is appropriate not to consider the Fine Paper Division as an off-site receptor.\n\n\n\n1.3 Risk Management System\n\nWestvaco Chemical Division has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) and related chemical safety and emergency response programs.  This management system identifies lines of responsibility for the entire program and each of its key elements.  \n\nThis management system is coordinated with the system developed by Westvaco's neighboring Fine Papers Division.\n\n2.0   PROCESS AND SUBSTANCE SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\n\nThe Westvaco Carbon Plant produces activated carbon from saw dust.  Activated carbon is a microcrystalline form of carbon with internal porosity and a large specific surface area.  This carbon is typically used for the purification of gas and liquid streams.  Activated carbon is used widely in industrial processes for the recovery and recycling of volatile organic compounds, and can also be used as a purifying filter for breathing air.  All automobiles produced in the U.S. since the early 1970s and most foreign-built automobiles are equipped with an emissions control system which utilizes activated carbon to adsorb gasoline emissions.  These emissions would otherwise be released to the atmosphere and contribute to the formation of ozone, a health hazard.  Activated carbon is also used in the treatment of drinking water to remove toxic and"

      "SummaryText": "3.2 Alternative Release for Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe alternative release examined for anhydrous ammonia corresponds to a hose rupture or coupling failure occurring during transfer from a tanker truck.  Liquefied ammonia from the leak could potentially spill into a generally unconfined area outside of the dike.  The ammonia release rate has been estimated to be equal to the normal transfer rate of 150 gallons/min (774 lb/min).  According to the EPA OCAG, this corresponds to a hose rupture of approximately 0.6 inches in diameter.  Release of liquefied gas to the air was conservatively assumed to be at the same rate as the spill because the portion that does not initially flash to a gas upon release would rapidly spread out into a shallow pool until the spill rate equaled the evaporation rate.  The spill is assumed to continue for 10 minutes before the truck operator or Westvaco personnel is able to activate the remote emergency shut-off valve.  \n\nA complete break of the unloading hose was also examined as a possible alternative release scenario.  A break of this type would result in a large pressure change in the ammonia delivery hose and a greater initial ammonia release rate.  An emergency check valve located on the tanker truck is designed to sense the change in pressure due to this type of break and immediately shut down the flow of ammonia. The resulting ammonia spill would be limited to the amount of ammonia contained in the hose.  Because the resulting distance to toxic endpoint is expected to be much smaller than the endpoint for the alternative release scenario discussed above, this release is not reported in the RMPlan.\n\n3.2.1 Dispersion Conditions\n\nEPA suggests that alternative release scenarios be analyzed using typical meteorological conditions of D stability, and a wind speed of 3 m/sec.  Stability Class D represents conditions of neutral stability, or moderate atmospheric turbulence.  A temperature of 77 0 F and relative humidity of 50 percent were al"

Figure 3-2 depicts the wind rose based on three years of data (1989-91) from the Paducah, WSO Airport. This indicates that the predominant direction of transport is toward the north.  \n\n3.2.2 Interpretation\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent releases that generally have a greater likelihood than the worst-case release and that occur during typical rather than worst-case meteorological conditions.  Unlike the worst-case release, alternative releases can account for both passive and active mitigation systems.  In accordance with EPA Guidance, the alternative release does not necessarily represent the type of release that the PSM hazard analysis and/or accident history indicate is the most likely to occur, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors. \n\n3.2.3 Modeling Method\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling to determine the distance to toxic endpoint was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*COMP (Version 1.06) software.  As discussed in Section 3.1.1, the modeling was performed using the conservative assumption of a rural surface roughness. The resulting planning zone is defined by a circle centered at the ammonia storage area with a radius equal to the distance to toxic endpoint of 0.50 miles (2640 ft.).  Figure 3-3 shows the circle that encompasses the alternative-release planning zone.  \n\n3.2.4 Public Receptors\n\nThe residential population within a circular area of this radius centered at the point of release is estimated to be approximately 30 persons.
