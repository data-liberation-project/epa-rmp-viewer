Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Schwan's has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.  \r\n\r\nFive year Accident History - Schwan's has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nSchwan's maintains 24/7 coverage at the site with emergency responders trained to the 24 hour HAZMAT first responders operation level at the facility with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.  The training is designed with a heavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, personal protective equipment up to use of Level A Suits and interaction with an incident command system / national incident management system (ICS/NIMS).  Copies of emergency plans are filed with the Florence Fire Department, and annual facility walkthroughs are conducted with Florence Fire Officers.  A post incident debriefing and investigation is conducted after each incident.  The Plant is fenced; security contractor is on site 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  The facility refrigeration team is on duty 24 hours/day, 7 days/week. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Since a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in the Schwan's company culture, improvements in system safety are implemented as a result of employee based Total Quality Management (TQM) teams, a designated PSM team, accepted industry practices, e.g., IIAR, EPA, and OSHA, and as a result of system engineering"

Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\r\n\r\nPre startup Reviews - Pre startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice at Schwan's.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits - Schwan's conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RAMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  Incident Investigation Schwan's promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - Schwan's truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

      "SummaryText": "The Schwan's (SFC Global Supply Chain, Inc.) facility located in Florence, Kentucky has historically placed a high priority on chemical safety.  The site's EHS Compliance Manager has been assigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and for ammonia refrigeration safety.  The site occupies approximately 35 acres in an open, relatively flat, industrial area.  Within 500 feet of the west side of the facility is the I 75/I 71 combined interstate, and 500 feet on the other side of the interstate is residential area.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSchwan's is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Florence facility manufactures frozen pizza.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the two refrigeration systems that are contained within the Schwan's property boundary.  Ammonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible refrigerant available.  Although it is toxic at high concentrations and is an irritating gas; it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dreadful diseases, and does not cause lasting environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release - Worst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the  RMP*COMP as well as the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply"
