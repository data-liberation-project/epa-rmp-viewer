The analysis are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the process unit for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC), operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\n*Steps for safely conducting activities\n*Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n*Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n  \nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup follo"

The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\nAll new operators receive ten weeks of comprehensive training before ever being assigned to a specific operating unit. This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process, and detailed review of complex procedures, such as, safe work practices and of emergency response. Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training material before a new employee can report to a process unit. Once a new employee reports to a particular process unit, he receives detailed training with respect to process specific procedures and for specific tasks; he is allowed to begin work in a specific operating unit.\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and, (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process. The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training.
