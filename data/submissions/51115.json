We are committed to promoting a safe working enviornment for our employees, the public and the envrionment. Our faciity uses Anyhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerent to cool the facilities production, shipping and storage areas.  The refrigeration system contains pressure vessels, compressors, condensers, air handlers, piping, valves, pumps and motors.  Our equipment is maintained by a preventative maintence program and a comprehensive Mechanical Integrity inspection and testing program. Our Safety Deparment is dedicated to providing Safety Programs that could involve any hazardous condition\n\nThe PSM Program is utilized to prevent the occurrence of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of castastrophic accidents.    Our system has safety devices in place, such as safety relief valves to prevent over-pressurization of vessels as well as back up rupture disk. Ammonia sensors are located throughout the facility.  Safety cut-outs and interlocks are installed on compressors and adminstrative controls are in place to prevent and control releases that could occur. Only trained operators for the ammonia refrigeration system have authority to turn valves, start compressors, and monitor the system.  The systems Standard Operating Procedures are available to operators at all times and located in the Control Room. \n\nPatrick Cudahy's commitement to our employees, the surronding commuity and the environment will continue to improve by utilizing new technology, improved design codes and standards, and trade organizations throughout the industry."
