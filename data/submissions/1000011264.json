We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility will produce six products from a raw mix Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) feed stream.  The products are ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, normal butane and Natural Gasoline using a small variety of chemicals and fractionation processing operations.  The facility is an integrated complex providing fractionation for mixed natural gas liquids, divided up into tow different operating units identified as the ACT Frac Unit and the Propylene Concentrator Unit (PCU). \n  \nAll feed streams to the units and product streams from the units are transported via pipelines.\n\nThe liquefied petroleum gases and other liquid hydrocarbons produced, stored, and distributed at th"

The process units operated by Enterprise involve the processing of liquefied petroleum \ngases (LPG) into their individual components such as ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The primary separation process utilized is fractionation by distillation.  Supplemental fired heat recovery units provide heat energy to the processes via a heat medium system.  A gas turbine is utilized to drive a refrigeration compressor while recovering the heated exhaust gases in one of the fired heat recovery units.  The facility utilizes an air assisted flare for any and all venting of the processes.  The plant has an ethanolamine based treating unit for the removal of Carbon Dioxide from the natural gas liquids.  Solid desiccant dehydration units are also part of the process to remove water from the natural gas liquid streams.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals used in the natural gas liquid fractionation operations at the Port Allen Plant.  \n\nFlammables\n\nEthane is a finished product at the Port Allen facility.  This product stream is the overhead product from two DeEthanizer towers.\n\nPropane is a finished product stream produced as the overhead product from two DePropanizer tower.\n\nPropylene is a finished product stream produced as the overhead product from the Propylene Splitter tower.\n\nButanes are produced from the overhead of the Debutanizer tower, which then are immediately fed to a DeIsobutanizer which separates the two types of butanes into separate product streams. Isobutane is a finished product from the overhead stream of the DeIsobutanizer.  Normal Butane is a finished product from the bottoms stream of the Deisobutanizer, and also from the bottom of a depropanizer in the Prop"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals on site and therefore there is no worst-case release scenario reported.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals on site and therefore there is no alternate-case release scenario reported.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the Propylene Splitter tower shell which contains a flammable mixture of hydrocarbons which are primarily Propylene and Propane, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario would not be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All ERT protocols would be in effect.  There would be no off site environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.  Details of the worst case scenario are given in the data elements of the Riak Management Program registration.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a flammable hydrocar"

Details of the alternate release scenario are given in the data elements of the Risk Management Program registration.  We are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-Startup Safety review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have numerous programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operations of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as being trained in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program which include all of the above listed areas.   All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique. \n\nWe have an ongoing inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the"

If anything out of the ordinary is found, it is repaired by the observer or reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAs of the submission date, there have been no accidental chemical releases meeting the criteria for reporting. There is a management system in place to ensure that all significant accidental releases occurring at our facility will be properly reported and recorded. In the future, if there are any accidental releases, we will conduct incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of any event(s) that may occur.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the West Baton Rouge Emergency Response Task Force which includes the Port Allen Police, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service as well as West Baton Rouge Parish Emergency Management system.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Port Allen Plant resolves all findings and recommendations from PHA's and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the few years in response to PHA, Incident Investigation and safety audit findings.\n\n>  The Enterprise safety management / accident prevention (PSM) program is currently undergoing a complete review and updating to insure that the program correctly reflects the safety management practices being used at Enterprise facilities."
