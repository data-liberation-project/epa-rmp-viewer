Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest\nrequirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n            \nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n         \n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n       Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code\n       Five-year accident history\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n          \nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n          \n       It stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold quantity\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (residence)\n       It does not operate under a SIC code specified in the rule\n       It has not had a reportable accident in the past five years\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM (this is a retail facility).\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary\nsource that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process,\nas determined under 40 CFR 68.115.

The facility also stores numerous smaller transportable tanks\n(nurse tanks) that are actually used in the fertilizer application process.        \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2) to\ndetermine program applicability.  Upland Co-op has chosen to use the EPA program RMP Comp\nto determine offsite impacts.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Parameters\n\n     1.   Land Use - Rural\n     2.   Release Qty - 125,000 lb \n     3.

The worst-case scenario requires a ground-level release\nheight (0 feet).  Release calculations are presented below:\n          \nSample Endpoint Calculation\n          \n     Given:    Largest Tank Capacity is 26,000 water gallons\n               Liquid Ammonia Density = 5.67 lb/gal (www.nh3.com)\n               Maximum Fill Volume = 85% capacity (Administrative Limit) \n\n     Release Rate   = Tank Capacity / 10 minutes\n                    = (26,000 gal * 5.67 lb/gal)*(0.85)  / 10 min \n                    = (147,420 lb)*(0.85) / 10 min\n                    = 125,000 (rounded) / 10 min\n                    = 12,500 lb/min \n\nInput of the preceding data into EPA's RMP Comp program, the results indicate a\nworst-case impact of 6.9 miles for the facil"

Release Duration - 10 min\n      \nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release because of a\nsudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this scenario is still unlikely because\nthe transfer hoses used have multiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless\nsteel wire underneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it is\nmore likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  This scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor line to the tank\ntruck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square\ninches.  Because personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, Upland\nCo-op personnel will respond within 10 minutes.
