      "SummaryText": "4.1 Accidental Release Prevention Policies\nThe City of Avenal WTP has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and\nconsideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Gaseous Chlorine\nDisinfection System. The City of Avenal WTP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n4.2 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\nChlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 6,000 pounds of chlorine kept in three (3) one-ton containers. Chlorine leak detection and warning is provided by high and low chlorine sensor alarms to control room with an audible and visual alarm system.\n\n4.3 Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis must be reviewed every five years or within six months of\nprocess changes or other changes that may significantly affect the results of the Off-site\nConsequence Analysis.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Gaseous\nChlorine Disinfection System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the\nGaseous Chlorine Disinfection System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment\ndocumentation.\n\n4.4 Risk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the City of Avenal WTP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible."

The facility has chlorine detectors that activate a SCADA alarm and local audible/visual alarms.\n\n4.5 Accidental Release Prevention Program\nAs part of the implementation of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program for the Chlorination System, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by  City of Avenal WTP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine for water treatment. Furthermore, common industry\nstandards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being\nperformed. The facility maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 6,000 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 2,500-lbs. threshold for EPA RMP, the 1,500-lbs. threshold for Cal/OSHA PSM and the 100-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program. As a result, the chlorine covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\n\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.1 Process Safety Information (PSI)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.2 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.3 Operating Procedures (OP)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.4 Training (TRN)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.5 Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.6 Management of Change (MOC)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.7 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.8 Compliance Audits (CA)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.9 Incident Investigation (II)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.10 Employee Participation (EP)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.11 Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n19 CCR \u00a7 5100.12 Cont"

The City of Avenal WTP has submitted a Hazardous Materials Business Plan in order to coordinate with the local emergency planning and response agencies to ensure that in an event of an emergency they are properly prepared and have knowledge of the system.\n\n4.8 External Events Analysis\nPursuant to the requirements of California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 5, Chapter 2,\nSection 5070.7 (q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of\nchlorine were addressed by the PHA. Additional seismic assessment evaluations were scheduled to be completed in 2025.\n\n4.9 Planned Changes To Improve Safety\nThe Compliance Audit has been conducted to examine any deficiencies at the Program 3 facility  improve the safety program.
