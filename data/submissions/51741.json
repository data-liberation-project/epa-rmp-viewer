      "SummaryText": "The Ranger Plant processes sweet natural gas entering the plant via pipeline from multiple natural gas wells in the area.  The plant compresses and removes natural gas liquids from the natural gas entering the facility.  The compressed natural gas and natural gas liquids exit the facility via two separate pipelines.\nNatural gas from multiple field wells enters the facility via several pipelines into five pig catchers.  The gas from the five pig catchers is routed to a single inlet gas separator that catches water and condensate present in the inlet gas.  The water and condensate from the inlet gas separator are pumped into a 300 barrel aboveground storage tank.  As this storage tank fills the contents are transferred via overflow piping to one of two 200 barrel aboveground storage tanks.  The water is transferred from each tank to a tank truck for shipment off-site, until only condensate remains in the tank.   The condensate from each tank is then transferred to a tank truck for shipment off-site. There are also two fuel storage tanks near the maintenance area that store fuel for use in plant vehicles and maintenance equipment.  One of the tanks stores gasoline and the other tank stores diesel fuel.\nThe gas compression at the facility is achieved via four natural gas compressors.  These compressors operate as necessary to achieve the desired compression pressure.  The compressors are powered by one 1,200 horsepower and three 600 horsepower reciprocal internal combustion engines.  All of these engines are fueled using a portion of the compressed outlet natural gas from the facility.\nThe fugitive emission areas of the plant are as follows:\n?    Inlet Gas Piping and Equipment\n?    Condensate Piping and Equipment\n?    Glycol Dehydration Unit Piping\n?    Methanol Injection System Piping and Equipment\n?    Propane Refrigeration System Piping and Equipment\n?    Residual/Outlet Gas Piping and Equipment\n?    Natural Gas Liquids Piping and Equipment\nThere is a propane refrigerant tank that has to"
