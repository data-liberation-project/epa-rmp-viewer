The Facility Policy\n\n      The owners, management, and employees of Bendena Grain Company are commited to the prevention\n      of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \n      prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and\n      minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information.\n\n      The primary activity at this  facility is  buying, selling and storing of grain and retailing farm supplies \n       including storage and sale of fertilizer to farmers.\n\n      Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to the soil for crop            \n      production purposes.\n\n      The maximum quanity stored would be 112,000 pounds (56,000 pounds in each of two 12,000 gallon\n      tanks).  \n\n3.   The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n      a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 12,000 gallon\n      tank released as a gas over 10 minutes, the maximum quanity release would be 56,000 pounds.\n      The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .74 miles.\n\n      b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break\n      in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (a point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.  \n\n4.   The accidental release prevention program.\n\n      We have implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \n      Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and \n      the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR \n      1910.111.  \"Storage and handling of "

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n      have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our know-\n      ledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage\n      or environmental damage.\n\n6.   The emergency response program.\n\n      We have:\n\n      a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 16-910.38.\n\n      b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know in-\n      formation as required under SARA Title LLL (EPCRA).\n\n      c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n      1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.   Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n      Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaulations are performence to \n      assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia \n      safety recomendations for implementation at this time."
