Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Gridley facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 557 Ord Ranch Road, Gridley, California, 95948 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 10,000-gallon and one 8,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 135,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  32,400 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 75,000 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 18,750 pounds ammonia based on a 25% active ingredient) within the secondary containment structure.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.48 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.
