      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Cytec Mt. Pleasant Site has been manufacturing chemicals safely for over 50 years.  The site originated as Victor Chemical in 1957.  The Site became part of Cytec Industries in August 2003 and later became a legal entity of Solvay Holding Inc. in 2016.  The Mt. Pleasant Site has 94 full-time employees.  The chemicals manufactured at the Mt. Pleasant Site are used by industries to make products familiar to our daily lives - plastics, acrylics, make-up, copper, and gold.  The Site consists of over 1600 acres with approximately 100 acres used as manufacturing space.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding and managing risks is a fundamental part of how we operate.  Cytec is committed to continuously improve its safety, health, and environmental performance.  The Mt. Pleasant site takes safety very seriously and the site has an excellent program in place to prevent accidental releases of all the chemicals we handle.  The site uses a variety of safety and operating procedures to prevent releases from occurring.  Our employees are committed to working safely with all of the chemicals the site handles as evidenced by an excellent safety record.\r\n\r\n(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Pleasant Site has one chemical that is covered by the RMP rule (phosphorus oxychloride).  This chemical is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This chemical is used as a raw material in our manufacturing process. The site will also be storing this chemical in one of our on-site warehouses separate from the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nSince this chemical is new to the Mt. Pleasant site, there have been no accidental chemical releases that have impacted the health and safety of the local community around our facility.  It is the site's policy to meet all the laws and regulations relevant to our industry at the local, state, and federal levels.  The properties that make these chemicals valuable as building blocks for our manufacturing processes also make it nec"

These precautions include handling all chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the site handles these chemicals combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nIf an accidental chemical release were to occur, the Mt. Pleasant Site has a comprehensive emergency response program to respond to such a release.   Our plant employees are trained as emergency responders and have both hazardous materials response and fire-fighting training.  Our emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire/police authorities who are responsible for notification of the local community if necessary.  \r\n\r\n(b) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe RMP covered substance, phosphorus oxychloride (CAS# 10025-87-3), is used as a raw material in our manufacturing process. This chemical is received by truck, packaged in drums and will be transported to the storage area and manufacturing process with a fork lift.  Access to the Site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n(c) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Pleasant Site manufacturing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The Mt. Pleasant site has an existing accidental release prevention program already in place that was developed for the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation.  The details of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n**Process Safety Information**\r\nWritten process safety information has been compiled for both of"

Pleasant Site management and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those production facilities involving highly hazardous chemicals. This information is kept current by the Safety, Health, and Environmental and Process Engineering Departments.  The data includes information pertaining to the hazards of the regulated substances, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  The information is available to all employees, 24 hours/day.\r\n\r\n**Process Hazards Analysis**\r\nProcess hazard analysis (PHA) have been completed on the covered process.  The site primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. Findings that result from the PHAs are promptly addressed.  The PHA teams are led by a trained PHA leader and are made up of a cross-section of plant departments, knowledgeable process engineers and include technicians from both the Production and Maintenance Departments.   Refer to Section 7 of the RMP submission for the Mt. Pleasant Site for specific details concerning the PHAs.  Any significant process changes include a PHA prior to implementation and startup. \r\n\r\n**Operating Procedures and Training\r\nThe Mt. Pleasant Site has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety information.  These operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including those that result from changes in process chemicals, technology, and equipment, and changes to facilities.

Pleasant Site has established written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment.  The mechanical integrity program includes inspection and testing procedures that follow recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency of inspections and tests of process equipment are consistent with applicable manufacturers' recommendations, Site Engineering Procedures, and good engineering practices, and more frequently if determined to be necessary by prior operating experience, and equipment history review.  Any deficiencies found during the inspection and testing are promptly corrected.  The mechanical integrity program includes training each employee involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to assure that the employee can perform the job tasks in a safe manner.\r\n\r\n**Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review**\r\nThe Mt. Pleasant Site has established and implemented a written procedure to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures; and changes to structures and facilities that affect a covered process.

Pleasant Site periodically conducts and audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate in these audits. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.\r\n\r\n**Incident Investigation**\r\nThe Mt. Pleasant Site investigates each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of any highly hazardous chemical in the workplace.  An incident investigation team is established immediately following an incident.  The investigation team consist of employees involved in the process and includes a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and an established system is in place to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations.  \r\n\r\n**Employee Participation**\r\nThe Mt.
