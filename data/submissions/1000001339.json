The Emergency Response Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation. This manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Americold Plant #80549 facility is located at 525 S. Kilroy Road in Turlock, California.  The facility is Situated  approximately one-third mile south of west Main Street and one-half mile west of Highway 99. The immediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas  to all sides\n\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as vegetables, and poultry.  The facility operates the ammonia refrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these food products.  The facility was originally built in 1985. The facility currently covers approximately 19.5 acres.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses ammonia for cold storage rooms and process equipment, the ammonia inventory exceeds the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including three low pressure receivers, the compressors, the sub cooler, and the purger. The pilot receiver, the high pressure receiver, the heat exchangers, and the condensers are mounted outside the engine room and all evaporative are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP reportable releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years \n\nF. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n1. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will Immediately go to the nearest public address system and announce: ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - THERE IS AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION). A supervisor in the area will determine whether or not the building must be evacuated.\n\n2. If the building is to be evacuated, the Supervisor will announce over the public address system:\nATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - EVACUATE THE BUILDING.  WE HAVE AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION).  WALK ! DO NOT RUN!\n\n3. The Supervisor on duty will immediately (upon hearing the alarm) call 911 to report the leak and give the address of the facility.  He or she will then evacuate the building.\n\n4. Employees will begin exiting  the building as per the published evacuation plan, and report to the proper area outside the building for a head count.\n\n5.
