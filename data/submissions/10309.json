The Garden City Gas Plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant which extracts hydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.  The raw natural gas streams are delivered via pipeline to the plant.  After extraction of the hydrocarbon liquids, residue gas and these liquids are sold as product.  Garden City Gas Plant consists of two process areas.  Trains A & B are located on the eastern section of the plant and trains C & D are located on the west section.  Both sections of the facility consist of inlet gas separation, dehydration, cryogenic gas processing, compression, product storage and loading equipment.

[Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: ethane-propane-butane-condensate (EPBC) mix, condensate, and propane.  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Garden City Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure.  For flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  EPBC (Ethane-Propane-Butane-Condensate) Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the EPBC mix in the largest EPBC mix vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantane"

In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the Garden City Gas Plant follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single \"alternative release scenario\" for all regulated flammable substances.  For the Garden City Gas Plant, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on the EPBC Mix pipeline pump, which was assumed to last for ten minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as leak detection, gas detection, and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact, but there is no impact to any receptors (i.e., residential populations, industrial, etc.), as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance, the \"Landview\" program census data, and actual survey data.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Garden City Gas Plant adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Garden City Gas Plant.

In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the plant, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, only then can they work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a high level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary, and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Garden City Gas Plant uses contractors to perform many project-specific activities and supplement the plant workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction periods.  For those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place, that when followed, ensure that these contractors:\n\n7 perform their work in a safe manner, \n7 have the appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely around the process,\n7 are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n7 understand what they should do in the event of an incident,\n7 understand and follow site safety rules, and\n7 inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that their work brings and/or that they find during their work.\n\nThe Garden City Gas Plant has developed and implemented safe work practices and procedures to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employers and employees in cove"

Each contract employee is provided an orientation on the known potential fire, explosion, or release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process, as well as the applicable provisions of the incident response plan.  \n\nContractor safety programs and safety performance are evaluated and become part of Conoco's contractor selection process.  Conoco personnel periodically monitor contractor safety programs and performance records.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThroughout the life of any operating facility, changes will often be necessary -- for example, to meet changing circumstances, to make needed improvements, or to alter the technology of the process.  The Garden City Gas Plant has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.  A critical piece of the MOC process ensures "

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSRs is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction, and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention, Process Safety Management Program, and Risk Management Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Garden City Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.  This mechanical integrity program includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems, among other items.  The basic aspects of this program include:\n\n(1) conducting training, \n(2) developing written procedures, \n(3) performing inspections and tests, \n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and \n(5) applying quality assurance measures. \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of "
