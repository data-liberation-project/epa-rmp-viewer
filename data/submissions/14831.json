      "SummaryText": "1096 LDEQ Facility ID Number\nMonsanto is a life science company committed to finding solutions to the growing global needs for food and health by sharing common forms of science and technology among agriculture, nutrition and health.  The companys 30,000 employees worldwide make and market high-value agricultural products, pharmaceuticals and food ingredients.  We are committed to pursuing these goals in sustainable ways that meet people's needs without compromising future generation's ability to meet their needs.\n\nOne of the locations contributing to this vision is Monsanto's Luling manufacturing plant, located at 12501 River Road in Luling, Louisiana.  This facility manufactures Roundup brand herbicide, acetaminophen, ACL brand active chlorine, and stores ammonia.  As part of operations, the facility handles sufficient quantities of chlorine, ammonia, formaldehyde, phosphorus trichloride, and isopropylamine to require compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.\n\nThe major elements of the RMP prevention program are very similar to OSHAs PSM regulation. OSHA has conducted an audit of our facility under their Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and has twice awarded their highest rating - \"Star\".  Receipt of this award demonstrates our commitment to the safety and health of employees and the surrounding community as well as protection of the environment.\n\nOur location has a documented Emergency Response plan which includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events, including inclement weather, fire and toxic chemical releases.  There are personnel responsible for implementation of this procedure on site at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) and other appropriate organizations.\n\nShould an event"

      "SummaryText": " occur:\nDEP is notified immediately.\nPlant personnel respond immediately.\nDEP determines possible community impact and takes appropriate action which could include no action, shelter-in-place, evacuation, or continual communications.\nMethods of communicating to the public include siren system, cable TV, radio, telephone alert system, and door-to-door.\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there has been one RMP defined accidental release event. It occurred on February 6, 1996 when approximately 6 pounds of formaldehyde was released from a storage tank vent during unloading.  As a result, one employee was exposed sufficiently to result in an OSHA recordable injury.  Although the DEP was notified as a precautionary measure, there was no discernable community impact. This incident was subsequently investigated according to established Monsanto procedure, and all corrective recommendations made by the investigating committee have been completed.\n\nBased on the type and number of RMP regulated substances present at this facility, eight accidental release scenarios have been provided, one toxic worst case, one flammable worst case, five toxic alternatives, and one flammable alternative.  Scenario selection was made by knowledgeable plant personnel, and off-site impacts determined using EPA methodologies.  The worst case scenario for each chemical assumes the entire contents of a vessel is discharged  in a 10 minute period, which is highly unlikely and sometimes physically impossible.  Alternate scenarios should be \"more likely events.\"\n\nThe toxic worst case scenario is a release of phosphorus trichloride from a rail car.   There are five toxic alternate scenarios, one each for ammonia, aqua-ammonia, formaldehyde, chlorine, and phosphorus trichloride.  Mitigation measure generally include emergency shut-down procedures, personnel detection, area sensors, and mass/volume differential computers.  The flammable worst case is a release of isopropylamine from a storage vessel.  Administrati"

There is one flammable alternate scenario for isopropylamine including an administrative control limit on inventory and area sensors.\n\nIn addition to and complimentary with the comprehensive prevention and emergency response program required under the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM rules, e.g., process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity, operating procedures, management of change procedure, and contractor /guest program, this facility employs numerous other boards, programs, and procedures to promote safety and communication, including:\n\nSafety Board with general oversight and regular meetings\nSafety committee and several subcommittees each with its own charter\nHuman elements awareness initiative\nCommunity advisory panel\nAdopt a school program\nHazardous material training\nPlant-wide training group\nCertified wildlife habitat site\n\nMaintaining and improving the safety of our operations is a core value at our location.
