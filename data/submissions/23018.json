The nearest potential public receptor to the aqueous ammonia storage facility is at least 600 feet away within the PG&E switchyard south of the ammonia storage equipment, and well beyond the distance of the toxic endpoint. \r\n\r\nSince CCPP has not had a release of a regulated substance in the past five years and there are no public receptors within 338 feet of the ammonia storage facility, CCPP qualifies for a Program 1 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations.\r\n\r\n1.5\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nSafety was the foremost consideration when designing the aqueous ammonia unloading and storage facility.  The location of the ammonia facility was selected to be in a low occupancy area of the plant at a maximum distance from the property fence line, to reduce potential offsite impacts due to a spill.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tanks will be enclosed within a walled containment basin that will slope to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the tanks that will run the length of the containment area.  There will also be a walled containment pad under the tanker truck unloading facility that will drain rapidly into the covered sump under the tanks.\r\n\r\nMany accident prevention safeguards will be implemented with the aqueous ammonia storage area.  For example in the event of a power outage, standby power needed for all required electrical systems, such as monitors and alarms, will be provided by the Uninterruptible Power Supply system.  Also hot work permits will be required for specific activities that present the potential for fire, and personnel involved in such operations will receive appropriate training."

Acute health hazards are those that occur from short exposures to airborne ammonia vapor, whereas chronic health effects are those that occur as a result of long-term exposures.\r\n\r\nThough there is some insoluble ammonia present in the ammonia solution, the solution has a very low vapor pressure compared to anhydrous ammonia, a more hazardous compound also used for SCR.  The ammonia present will not readily vaporize if the solution is released to the atmosphere.  If the ammonia evaporates from the solution, the ammonia vapor is irritating at levels above a few parts per million volume (ppmv) and acutely toxic in high concentrations.  A one-hour average ammonia vapor concentration above 200 ppmv could cause respiratory irritation to exposed individuals.  According to the National Research Council, exposure at the 75 ppmv STPEL level should not result in serious effects, but would result in strong odor, lacrimation, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat), but no incapacitation or prevention of self-rescue.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia vapor is flammable in air at concentrations of 16 percent to 25 percent, but requires a very high temperature source for ignition.  Ammonia concentrations directly above an aqueous ammonia spill never approach these concentrations; therefore aqueous ammonia has no explosive flammability potential.\r\n\r\n1.4\tWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nMirant performed an offsite consequence analysis to examine the significance of an accidental release of aqueous ammonia.  The hypothetical worst-case release scenario examined the effects of releasing an entire 20,000 gallon storage tank.

      "SummaryText": "delivery and injection facilities for each SCR will include aqueous ammonia feed pumps, ammonia vaporization equipment, and ammonia injection grid.  In the SCR system, aqueous ammonia is piped from the storage tanks to spray nozzles in the ammonia vaporizer unit on the injection skids near the SCR reactor.  The spray droplets are then mixed with a hot air diluent stream in the vaporizer to evaporate the ammonia.  The vaporizer produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia in the diluent stream.  The diluent stream is then transported to the injection grid.  Figure 1-3 presents a simple ammonia flow diagram for the SCR system.\r\n\r\nThe injection grid is located upstream of the SCR reactor.  This allows more thorough mixing of the ammonia-laden diluent stream with the turbulent flue gas from the Units.  Although the oxidation-reduction reaction is initiated by the injection of ammonia at the injection grid, all of the reaction is completed in the SCR reactor by passing the mixture over a catalyst composed primarily of titanium and vanadium oxides.  The treated flue gas, containing a small amount of residual NOX and excess ammonia, is discharged out of the stack.\r\n\r\nThe SCR process is controlled with feed-forward and feedback control loops.  An upstream NOX analyzer will measure the NOX concentration at the SCR reactor inlet.  A downstream analyzer will measure the total NOx concentration downstream of the SCR reactor outlet.  The ammonia demand signal, which regulates the rate at which aqueous ammonia is pumped to the vaporizer, is determined from both NOx analyzers.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia solution proposed for the SCR systems at CCPP will be 29.4 percent ammonia by weight with the balance of the weight being water.

The concentration of ammonia in the aqueous solution will be 29.4 % by weight.  This substance is listed as a hazardous material under both California and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment, a federal program was established in 1990 as described in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The California Office of Emergency Services established the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The CalARP Program specifies the regulated substances, oversees the federal requirements, and determines the requirements for the preparation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and offsite accidental release consequence analysis.  In Contra Costa County, the Administering Agency overseeing the CalARP program is the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD), to whom this RMP will be submitted along with submission to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).\r\n\r\nAfter the expansion, the quantity of aqueous ammonia to be stored and used at the Contra Costa Power Plant (CCPP) will be greater than both the Federal and State Threshold Quantities; therefore a RMP is required.

The new Unit 8 will also utilize SCR systems to reduce its NOx emissions and comply with its permitted NOx emission limits.
