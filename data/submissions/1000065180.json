Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nWe at Leprino Foods Company - Lemoore West, are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers area such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Kings County hazardous materials teams, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 351 N. Belle Haven Drive, Lemoore, CA. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, at our facility which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum intended inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at our facility is approximately 197,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLeprino Foods Company - Lemoore West maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemicals operating parameter"
