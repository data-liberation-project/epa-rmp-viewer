This ERP has been communicated to the Goodbe Fire Department, the Mandeville Fire Department, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \n\nThe facility has personnel trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.  The facility also has employees trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician Level and Incident Commander Level.  These individuals also are trained to respond to a release by stopping the release, thereby assuming a more aggressive role than those trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  The ERP describes the conditions under which Diversified Foods and Seasonings personnel would attempt to stop a chemical release, as well as the sequence of actions that would be undertaken under those circumstances. Some of the Hazardous Material Technicians are further trained to the Incident Commander Level. This individual will assume the responsibility of Incident Commander until the fire department arrives on-scene.

Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n \nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC. \n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis -A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the What-if technique.

The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n \nThe facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan with the responsibility to notify the Goodbe and Mandeville Fire Departments of an incident for a timely response.  Trained Diversified Foods and Seasonings personnel will initiate safety systems as they evacuate to minimize the impact of the emergency. Once the Fire Department arrive on-scene they will assume the role of Incident Commander and have control the incident. \nThe facility in the process of forming an Emergency Response Team that will respond to hazardous material releases with the Goodbe and Mandeville Fire Departments.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \nThis food processing facility operates a two-stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacity of 981 TR @ +20F high temperature suction and 588 TR @ -50F low temperature suction. This high-temperature side of the refrigeration system is a direct expansion system. The low-temperature side of the refrigeration system is a liquid-recirculating system and is designed to operate with an overfeed-ratio of approximately 4:1 for low-side air units. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\n \nEngine room electrical classification is NEMA-1. \n\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains six interconnected sub-systems: \n\n1.

Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown. \n\nTraining - All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n \nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\n \nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems.

Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done.
