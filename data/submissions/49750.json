The Honeywell Kingman Facility?s storage and use of ethylene oxide exceeds the specified threshold of 10,000 lbs., as defined by the EPA?s RMP Rule.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the Honeywell Kingman Facility: \n\n\n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Kingman Facility to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of ethylene oxide involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a professionally trained Safety Brigade, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community. \n\n\n\n2) Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled:  \n\n\n\nThe Kingman Facility is located in the Kingman Airport Industrial Park at 4790 Olympic Drive, Kingman, Arizona.

At the Kingman facility, EO is stored in the same rail car in which it is shipped.  The car is surrounded by a water deluge system for fire protection and to suppress vapors in the unlikely event a leak should occur.  The EO car is only connected to the EO distribution piping when a transfer is being made to a blend tank.  At all other times the car is disconnected and sealed.  Transfers occur on an average of twice per month and take about 4 hours.\n\n\n\n3.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific accident prevention program\n\n\n\nThe Kingman facility has a comprehensive general accidental release prevention program.

Recommendations from these reviews have been studied and implemented as appropriate.  Safeguards include the following engineering controls:\n\n\n\n1)    EO is shipped to the facility in two specially designed and constructed railcars.  These cars exceed DOT standards for the transport of EO and are only used to transport EO to the Kingman facility.  In order to minimize the amount of EO in the facility, only one car is present at the site at a time, and the cars hold a maximum of 75,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n2)    The only storage of pure EO that occurs at the Kingman facility is in the railcar in which the EO was shipped to the facility.  The EO car is only connected to the facility?s EO distribution system while a transfer to a blend tank is occurring.  At all other times, the car is disconnected and sealed.  By following this procedure, the facility minimizes the risk of contamination of the railcar and reduces the potential for leaks in the transfer piping.\n\n\n\n3)    The EO car is positioned under a water deluge system at all times while on the facility.  The deluge will protect the car in the event of a fire or, if the car should begin to leak, the deluge can be used to suppress the escaping vapor.

The collection pan drains underground to a below ground lined collection basin.\n\n\n\n4)    When the EO car is positioned under the water deluge system, there is an EO detection point immediately above the dome of the car.  There is also a detection point next to the EO transfer pump.  These detectors are set to activate a local alarm at 15 ppm EO.  The facility?s off site security company receives an alarm at 30 ppm EO so that it can notify plant personnel 24 hours a day.  The detector on top of the railcar is set to turn on the water deluge at .7% EO to suppress escaping vapor and prevent ignition.  Early awareness of small EO leaks helps the facility take the appropriate action to prevent a release that would impact off site population.\n\n\n\n5)    The hose used to transfer liquid EO from the EO railcar to the distribution system is a double walled hose.  If the inner hose fails, the EO is trapped inside the outer hose and does not escape.  The annular space between the hoses is checked for pressure each time the car is connected.  The annular space is checked for trace amounts of EO every 6 months.  If a leak in the inner hose is detected, the hose is replaced.  This procedure reduces the risk of a serious failure of the transfer hose resulting in a significant leak.\n\n\n\n6)    The liquid and vapor outlets of the EO railcar are connected through automatic valves during transfers to the blend tanks.  The automatic valves will close to isolate the contents of the railcar in the event of abnormal circumstances.  By closing the automatic valves on the EO car during abnormal conditions, the amount of EO that can potentially be released if a leak should occur is minimized.\n\n\n\n7)    All four-blend tanks are equipped with safety relief valves to release excess pressure in the tank prior to catastrophic failure of the vessel.

      "SummaryText": ", each tank has remotely operated automatic valves on all bottom outlets from the tanks.  The valves can be used to isolate the tank contents from transfer piping from a remote location in the event a leak occurs.  Shutting these valves minimizes the amount of material that may leak out.\n\n\n\n8)    In conjunction with the EO detection system described in Item 4 above, an additional EO monitoring system covers the Kingman facility.  This system alarms when an EO concentration in excess of 1 ppm is detected at any one of 20 monitoring points.  3 of these monitoring points are located at the property fence line and will provide warning should a release in the facility have a potential off site impact.  \n\n\n\n4) The Five Year Accident History:\n\n The Kingman facility has never had a release of ethylene oxide that had a significant on site or offsite impact.\n\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Plan: \n\n\n\nThe Kingman facility has a written facility specific Plant Emergency Response and Spill Plan.  It is the objective of the Plan to ?provide sufficient information to formulate an initial response to a fire, explosion, or any unplanned release of hazardous material to the air, soil, or surface water at the facility.?\n\n\n\nIn the event of a Plant Emergency, all personnel in the facility have been trained to gather at the assembly point.  The nature of the emergency will then be determined and, if the emergency can be handled with plant personnel and there is no potential for off site impact, mitigation of the emergency will begin immediately.\n\n\n\nIf the emergency includes a fire or has the potential for off site impact, the Hualapai Valley Fire Department and the Sheriff?s department will be notified to coordinate fire fighting and evacuation of the surrounding population respectively.  In addition the Mohave County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) will be notified to assist as necessary.\n\n\n\nFirst aid and subsequent treatment of any injured plant personnel or surrounding population w"

KRMC has a fact book on the Kingman facility?s Chemicals, including Material Safety Data Sheets and treatment recommendations.\n\n\n\nAll plant personnel receive a minimum of 16 hours of emergency response training each year.  This training includes classroom training as well as hands on training of simulated emergencies.  The Hualapai Valley Fire Department has sent personnel to participate in the 16-hour emergency response session held each fall.\n\n\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\n\n\nThe Kingman facility has never had an RMP accident.  However, all incidents that cause or have the potential to cause injury to personnel or significant damage to equipment, the environment, or the public are investigated.  From those investigations several changes have been made to the equipment and procedures at the Kingman facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition, a Process Hazards Analysis has been completed for all processes that use regulated chemicals.  These analyses are used to review areas involved in the use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or onsite movement of regulated chemicals.  The analyses are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis.\n\n\n\nRecommendations for changes to improve process safety are gathered from the incident investigations and hazard reviews.  All outstanding recommendations have been carefully reviewed and appropriate measures have been implemented at the Kingman facility.\n\n"
