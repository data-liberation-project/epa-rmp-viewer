Oxyfume 2000 is used primarily by medical device manufacturers to sterilize medical devices such as sutures and lens implants prior to shipment to hospitals and doctor\u00bfs offices.  Oxyfume 2002 is used primarily by hospitals to sterilize reusable heat sensitive devices such as various types of scopes used for arthoscopic surgery.\r\n\r\nThe Plant Manager of the Kingman facility is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and is active in helping to prepare the community to handle a potential emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe only chemical in the Kingman facility that requires the facility to participate in EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program is EO.  At the Kingman facility, EO is stored in the same rail car in which it is shipped.  The car is surrounded by a water deluge system for fire protection and to suppress vapors in the unlikely event a leak should occur.  The EO car is only connected to the EO distribution piping when a transfer is being made to a blend tank.  At all other times the car is disconnected and sealed.  Transfers occur on an average of twice per month and take about 4 hours.\r\n\r\n3.\tGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific accident prevention program\r\n\r\nThe Kingman facility has a comprehensive general accidental release prevention program.

The collection pan drains underground to a below ground lined collection basin.\r\n\r\n4)\tWhen the EO car is positioned under the water deluge system, there is an EO detection point immediately above the dome of the car.  There is also a detection point next to the EO transfer pump.  These detectors are set to activate a local alarm at 15 ppm EO.  The facility\u00bfs off site security company receives an alarm at 30 ppm EO so that it can notify plant personnel 24 hours a day.  The detector on top of the railcar is set to turn on the water deluge at .7% EO to suppress escaping vapor and prevent ignition.  Early awareness of small EO leaks helps the facility take the appropriate action to prevent a release that would impact off site population.\r\n\r\n5)\tThe hose used to transfer liquid EO from the EO railcar to the distribution system is a double walled hose.  If the inner hose fails, the EO is trapped inside the outer hose and does not escape.  The annular space between the hoses is checked for pressure each time the car is connected.  The annular space is checked for trace amounts of EO every 6 months.  If a leak in the inner hose is detected, the hose is replaced.  This procedure reduces the risk of a serious failure of the transfer hose resulting in a significant leak.\r\n\r\n6)\tThe liquid and vapor outlets of the EO railcar are connected through automatic valves during transfers to the blend tanks.

In order to minimize the amount of EO in the facility, only one car is present at the site at a time, and the cars hold a maximum of 75,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\n2)\tThe only storage of pure EO that occurs at the Kingman facility is in the railcar in which the EO was shipped to the facility.  The EO car is only connected to the facility\u00bfs EO distribution system while a transfer to a blend tank is occurring.  At all other times, the car is disconnected and sealed.  By following this procedure, the facility minimizes the risk of contamination of the railcar and reduces the potential for leaks in the transfer piping.\r\n\r\n3)\tThe EO car is positioned under a water deluge system at all times while on the facility.  The deluge will protect the car in the event of a fire or, if the car should begin to leak, the deluge can be used to suppress the escaping vapor.  Should an exothermic reaction occur in the car, the deluge can be used to remove the heat of reaction.  The deluge is activated by fire o"

      "SummaryText": ", each tank has remotely operated automatic valves on all bottom outlets from the tanks.  The valves can be used to isolate the tank contents from transfer piping from a remote location in the event a leak occurs.  Shutting these valves minimizes the amount of material that may leak out.\r\n\r\n8)\tIn conjunction with the EO detection system described in Item 4 above, an additional EO monitoring system covers the Kingman facility.  This system alarms when an EO concentration in excess of 1 ppm is detected at any one of 20 monitoring points.  3 of these monitoring points are located at the property fence line and will provide warning should a release in the facility have a potential off site impact.  \r\n\r\n4) The Five Year Accident History:\r\n The Kingman facility has never had a release of ethylene oxide that had a significant on site or offsite impact.\r\n\r\n5) The Emergency Response Plan: \r\n\r\nThe Kingman facility has a written facility specific Plant Emergency Response and Spill Plan.  It is the objective of the Plan to \u00bfprovide sufficient information to formulate an initial response to a fire, explosion, or any unplanned release of hazardous material to the air, soil, or surface water at the facility.\u00bf\r\n\r\nIn the event of a Plant Emergency, all personnel in the facility have been trained to gather at the assembly point.  The nature of the emergency will then be determined and, if the emergency can be handled with plant personnel and there is no potential for off site impact, mitigation of the emergency will begin immediately.\r\n\r\nIf the emergency includes a fire or has the potential for off site impact, the Hualapai Valley Fire Department and the Sheriff\u00bfs department will be notified to coordinate fire fighting and evacuation of the surrounding population respectively.  In addition the Mohave County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) will be notified to assist as necessary.\r\n\r\nFirst aid and subsequent treatment of any injured plant personnel or surrounding population w"

      "SummaryText": "ill be handled by Kingman Regional Medical Center.  KRMC has a fact book on the Kingman facility\u00bfs Chemicals, including Material Safety Data Sheets and treatment recommendations.\r\n\r\nAll plant personnel receive a minimum of 16 hours of emergency response training each year.  This training includes classroom training as well as hands on training of simulated emergencies.  The Hualapai Valley Fire Department has sent personnel to participate in the 16-hour emergency response session held each fall.\r\n\r\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety: \r\n\r\nThe Kingman facility has never had an RMP accident.  However, all incidents that cause or have the potential to cause injury to personnel or significant damage to equipment, the environment, or the public are investigated.  From those investigations several changes have been made to the equipment and procedures at the Kingman facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a Process Hazards Analysis has been completed for all processes that use regulated chemicals.  These analyses are used to review areas involved in the use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or onsite movement of regulated chemicals.  The analyses are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis.\r\n\r\nRecommendations for changes to improve process safety are gathered from the incident investigations and hazard reviews.  All outstanding recommendations have been carefully reviewed and appropriate measures have been implemented at the Kingman facility."
