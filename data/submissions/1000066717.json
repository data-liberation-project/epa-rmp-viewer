At this site, Albemarle produces sample quantities (1 kg level) to semi-commercial quantities of various catalysts, flame retardants, agricultural intermediates, and pharmaceutical products.  Additionally, Albemarle has truck unloading facilities to receive and store elemental bromine.  This bromine has been supplied via pipeline to an adjacent external facility and to processes within the plant for over a decade.\n\n\n\nCurrently Albemarle has on site RMP covered levels of one toxic chemical (bromine), and one flammable chemical (diethyl ether) that are above RMP threshold quantities.  Bromine is used extensively in two processes, 1) the Bromine supply terminal, and 2) manufacture of a polymeric flame retardant, HP-7010.  Bromine can be used in lesser quantities in the Pilot Plant Building for process development purposes.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - In its operations, Albemarle is committed to the safety of the surrounding community, as well as protection of the environment.  With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Albemarle combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of bromine.  In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control.  Emergency responders are trained annually, and a trained Incident Commander is on site at all times to coordinate emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History - There have been no offsite accidents at this location that had any adverse effects to neighboring industry or the co"

      "SummaryText": "mmunity.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Albemarle is committed to an ever improving safety program to maintain its rating in the top 5% in the chemical industry.  We conduct Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) of all chemical operations including lab safety audits for all bench scale processes for new projects.  We conduct Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to improve the quality of PHA studies to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness.   We also conduct reactive hazard evaluations on all processes, with the goal of identifying reactive hazards which might occur during normal or upset conditions.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Albemarle employs the latest technology in its process controls, monitoring, and mitigation systems to ensure that accidental releases are prevented or the risks associated with them are minimized.  Process documentation for covered processes are in compliance with OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process Safety Management (PSM).  Equipment inspections are scheduled and documented to ensure vessel integrities.  Bromine storage and handling equipment are either glass-lined carbon steel, kynar lined piping, or nickel piping and vessel.  Bromine detectors are maintained and tested on a regular frequency to aid in early detection of bromine releases.  Hydrocarbon detectors are strategically located to detect the release of flammable materials.\n\n"
