The procedures address all aspects of plant activities including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, safe work practices, incident investigation, audits, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\nThe prevention program consists of many elements and policies, which are briefly outlined below.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - Employees are involved in all aspects of the program and are provided any information developed in the program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION - All necessary process information and records are maintained in several convenient locations including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology with safe operating limits, and equipment records and design requirements.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS - Several employees have had extensive professional training in the methods of process hazard analysis (PHA) and are available to act as PHA team leaders.  These reviews are updated on a regular basis.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - Operating procedures are in place for all aspects of operation including emergency operation and shutdown.\n\nOPERATIONS TRAINING - All operators are trained initially in the process and its operating procedures and are supervised by an experienced operator for a lengthy training period before being allowed to control the process on their own.  They must demonstrate competency in all aspects of the plant operation including unexpected malfunctions.\n\nCONTRACTORS - Contractor selection includes review of safety performance and programs.

This assures that construction and equipment is installed in accordance with design, all necessary procedures including safety procedures are in place, training is completed, and that hazard analysis or requirements of management of change are completed.\n\nMACHANICAL INTEGRITY - This is a quality assurance procedure to assure that equipment, parts, materials, and installations are suitable for the applications intended.  Maintenance employees are trained in the process hazards and in safety procedures applicable to their work.  Inspections, procedures and testing are conducted under this part of the program.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES - Procedures and policies for work permits and maintenance lock-out-tag-out procedures.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE - No changes in process or procedures are allowed without review and authorization.  Safety impacts, technical review, required procedure modifications, and training are all considered in the review.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION - Any accident, near-miss, or incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a release is promptly investigated by a facility team.  Findings of the investigation and recommendations for corrective action are documented, as is the resolution of the recommendations and corrective actions.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT - Compliance with the program is audited at least every three years to verify compliance with these procedures.  Findings of the audit are documented and any deficiencies are corrected and documented.\n\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known"

This facility has had one incident that occurred on December 6, 1996, which resulted in a release of 142 tons of ammonia and one employee was hospitalized for an extended period of time.  Within a year the employee has returned to full duty. As a result of this incident an investigation team was formed to thoroughly evaluate the causes of this incident.  The team recommended and the companys engineering department instituted a variety of improvements and mitigation systems to prevent a future occurrence.  No off-site impacts resulted from this release. \n\nSYNOPSIS OF WORST AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances.  The rule requires an analysis involving the release of the total contents of the largest storage vessel of ammonia at this site.  This is called the \"worst case toxic release scenario\" (worst case scenario) and involves the release of 186 tons of ammonia.  This release must be considered to occur over a 10-minute period and all of the ammonia must be considered to convert to gas instantly.  We have retained a consultant to model this unlikely release utilizing a model known as DEGADOSE.  His results, modeling according to the rule, determined that there would be only minor off-site impact.  This worst case is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nAn alternate scenario, which is a more likely event, is required to be submitted.  The alternate chosen involved the release of ammonia from a transfer pipe where 60,000 pounds would be released over a 15 minute period.  A significantly lower quantity is involved because various shutdown safeguards are present and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the quantity of failures.  The same modeling "
