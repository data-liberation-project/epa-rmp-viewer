(FHLP) is a limited partnership corporation formed by Farmland Industries, the largest U.S. farmers\u0012 cooperative headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, and Norsk Hydro ASA, a large Norwegian company engaged in fertilizer, oil and gas, and specialty metals.  Farmland Industries is a highly diversified company with major business lines in crop production and crop protection products, livestock feeds, petroleum, grain processing and marketing, and the processing and marketing of pork and beef products serving the needs of its 600,000 United States farmer-owners.\n\nThe Farmland Hydro, L.P. Green Bay Chemical Complex is located on County Road 640, about 6 miles southwest of Bartow in the southwest part of Polk County Florida.  The facility primarily manufactures phosphate fertilizers commonly known as DAP (diammonium phosphate) and MAP (monoammonium phosphate) which is used to produce high quality fertilizers used in crop production around the world.  The facility was built by Farmland Industries in 1965 and underwent several expansions and modernization resulting in a tripling of production capacity.\n\nThe facility is situated on about 2,500 acres of property bounded by CR 640 on the south and Bonnie Mine road on the west.  The facility contains a phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond system of about 500 acres in size and maintains an NPDES (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System) permit for waste water, a State of Florida issued ground water permit as well as a Title V air permit.  We currently have plans for expansion of the gypstack and the opening of a mine in"

The procedures address all aspects of plant activities including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, safe work practices, incident investigation, audits, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\nThe prevention program consists of many elements and policies, which are briefly outlined below.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - Employees are involved in all aspects of the program and are provided any information developed in the program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION - All necessary process information and records are maintained in several convenient locations including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology with safe operating limits, and equipment records and design requirements.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS - Several employees have had extensive professional training in the methods of process hazard analysis (PHA) and are available to act as PHA team leaders.  These reviews are updated on a regular basis.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - Operating procedures are in place for all aspects of operation including emergency operation and shutdown.\n\nOPERATIONS TRAINING - All operators are trained initially in the process and its operating procedures and are supervised by an experienced operator for a lengthy training period before being allowed to control the process on their own.  They must demonstrate competency in all aspects of the plant operation including unexpected malfunctions.\n\nCONTRACTORS - Contractor selection includes review of safety performance and programs.  All contractor employees are required to attend an initial 16 hour OSHA/MSHA structured class offered at several local community training facilities."

Inventories are purposely kept low to reduce the risk of exposure should an accidental release occur.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  It is the personal challenge and policy of the management and associates of this facility to identify and reduce or eliminate all recognized process hazards, not only involving the regulated substance but of all hazardous substances and circumstances.\n\nTo achieve the goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n\n7 A knowledgeable, highly trained and motivated employee group\n7 A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n7 Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n7 Preparation and training for emergencies\n\nFHLP has had a written Emergency Response Plan in effect for many years and is annually reviewed.  Employees are trained regularly in the event of an emergency.  The plan is designed to prevent employee exposure and to coordinate with local emergency response agencies in the event of a release.  A general plant alarm is in operation and also a system of immediate neighbor notification.  This plan is coordinated with the local community response plan and is available to those responding agencies.  Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III has been provided to the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Green Bay facility is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management rule and is therefore under the EPA Risk Management Rule and is a Program 3 facility with a Program 3 Prevention Program.  The OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facili"

      "SummaryText": "off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  This facility has had one incident that occurred on December 6, 1996, which resulted in a release of 142 tons of ammonia and one employee was hospitalized for an extended period of time.  Within a year the employee has returned to full duty. As a result of this incident an investigation team was formed to thoroughly evaluate the causes of this incident.  The team recommended and the company\u0012s engineering department instituted a variety of improvements and mitigation systems to prevent a future occurrence.  No off-site impacts resulted from this release. \n\nSYNOPSIS OF WORST AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances.  The rule requires an analysis involving the release of the total contents of the largest storage vessel of ammonia at this site.  This is called the worst case toxic release scenario (worst case scenario) and involves the release of 186 tons of ammonia.  This release must be considered to occur over a 10-minute period and all of the ammonia must be considered to convert to gas instantly.  We have retained a consultant to model this unlikely release utilizing a model known as DEGADOSE.  His results, modeling according to the rule, determined that there would be only minor off-site impact.  This worst case is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nAn alternate scenario, which is a more likely event, is required to be submitted.  The alternate chosen involved the release of ammonia from a transfer pipe where 60,000 pounds would be released over a 15 minute period.  A significantly lower quantity is involved because various shutdown safeguards are present and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the quantity of failures.  The same modeling"

Many process safeguards have been implemented as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis and incident investigation activities.  Such things as remote shut-down systems, early detection sensors, surveillance monitors and water deluge systems have all been installed within the last two years in response.  It is the understanding of FHLP that through the diligent application of the elements of the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program that our employees and the community can be assured that emergency response will never be necessary."
