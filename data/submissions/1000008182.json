The MWTP has established four levels of events involving the potential for a chlorine leak or an actual chlorine leak.\n\nLevel  I.\t\nChlorine containers are being delivered by the vendor or being installed by plant personnel. Response to small leaks occurring upon connection of container or during system maintenance. Valves can be closed and sections isolated for needed repair. A chlorine action form must be completed before beginning the operation. The Fire Department need not be notified.\n\nLevel  II.\t\nMaintenance or replacement is being performed for a faulty online device such as a tank valve. Chlorine is not being released. However, the device cannot be easily isolated or the chlorine evacuated. A chlorine action form must be completed before beginning the operation. The procedure will not begin until Fire Department personnel are adjacent to Plant in standby mode.\n\nLevel  III.\t\nChlorine gas is being released but the situation is under control.  Liquid chlorine is not being released. The Chlorine Scrubber is operating properly. The release is curr"

Plant staff will not attempt to stop the leak. Level III represents an emergency that requires a \u00c2\u00bf911\u00c2\u00bf call to the Fire Department.\n  \nLevel  IV.\t\nChlorine gas is being released and the situation may  be out of control. The release rate is large or could likely become so. The release may include liquid chlorine.  The Chlorine Scrubber may not be operating. The release has or likely will escape the storage building and threaten the surrounding area. Under no circumstances will entry be made into the chlorine storage area. Any necessary repairs will be made by a trained HazMat team from either the City of Arlington or the City of Fort Worth.  MFD has mutual aid agreements with both the Arlington and Fort Worth.\n\nThe MWTP has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nThe MWTP began the Phase 4 expansion project in February 2009. The expansion will include a hypochlorite generation system which will eliminate the use of chlorine for disinfection of treated water from this facility. Chlorine will continue to be used in the production of Chlorine Dioxide. This will reduce our on site capacity to (2) one ton containers. The MWTP will continue to review and evaluate chlorine procedures. Plant staff will be required to take the chlorine safety and maintenance class every three years minimum."
