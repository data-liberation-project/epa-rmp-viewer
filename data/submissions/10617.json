The facility handles quantities of propane, butane and isobutane in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Planning (RMP) threshold planning quantity for a flammable substance. The facility is considered a RMP program 3 facility.\n\nThe facility is primarily regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), as it is part of our interstate pipeline system.  The DOT-regulated part of the facility includes the large aboveground storage \"breakout\" tanks and the associated piping.  DOT-regulated facilities are exempted from the Risk Management Plan requirements, since the DOT already requires an emergency contingency plan for them. \n\nThe DOT does not exercise regulatory authority over below ground storage; therefore, the three underground LPG storage caverns are regulated by the RMP requirements.\n\nThe facility receives propane, butane and isobutane via a DOT-regulated pipeline, stores propane in a 4,200,000 gallon underground storage cavern, butane in a 4,200,000 gallon underground storage cavern, isobutane in a 2,000,000 gallon underground storage cavern, and delivers these products to a DOT-regulated pipeline for transportation to markets.\n\nThe underground storage caverns at the facility are subject to and comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  The facility also prepares and provides annual SARA Tier II Chemical Inventory reports to the State Emergency Planning Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department.\n\nThe facility has process controls in place, including: automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facility has UV/IR fire detection \"eyes\" process area detectors. A Process Hazard "

      "SummaryText": "Analysis (PHA) is conducted every five years as part of the OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nFacility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing, and emergency response training. The facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is a release from the propane underground storage cavern. The quantity of propane that could be released and contribute to the worst case scenario is estimated at 420,000 gallons of propane (1,800,000 pounds), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The worst case scenario vapor cloud explosion would potentially affect nearby public receptors.\n\nThe facility has not had any chemical release accident at the underground storage caverns since starting operations in 1967."
