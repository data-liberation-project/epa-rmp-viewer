      "SummaryText": "on how to proceed.\n - We pursue an open dialogue with all relevant opinion leaders in society.  Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Whitestone Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Whitestone Site uses anhydrous ammonia, ethylene oxide, and propylene oxide.  These chemicals are used to manufacture surfactants, and a mold growth inhibitor on silage.  These products are used in industrial and commercial detergents, personal hygiene products, gasoline additives, defoaming agents, agricultural chemicals, oil field chemicals, animal feeds, etc.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\nCatastrophic failure of an ethylene oxide rail car with off-site impacts.\n\nAlternatives\n\n- Pipe leak of anhydrous ammonia with off-site impacts.  Active mitigation includes area vapor detectors, fire water suppression systems, piping isolation, and well-trained emergency responders.\n\n- Pipe leak of ethylene oxide with off-site impacts.  Active mitigation includes area vapor detectors, fire water suppression systems, piping isolation, and well-trained emergency responders.\n\n- Pipe leak of propylene oxide with off-site impacts.  Active mitigation includes area vapor detectors, fire water suppression systems, piping isolation, and well-trained emergency responders.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and  the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code.  Prevention program elements include:\n  - Automatic shut-off devices and relief valves handle unexpected rises in temperature or pressure.\n  - Safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and leak detectors, provide multiple layers of protection.\n  - Continuous monitoring of pressure in vesse"
