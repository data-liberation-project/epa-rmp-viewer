      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nAbsolute Energy, LLC (Facility ID: 100000202318)\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nAbsolute Energy, L.L.C. (AE) owns and operates a nameplate 100,000,000 gallon per year (100 MMgal/yr) denatured fuel-grade ethanol and industrial grade undenatured ethanol plant. The plant is permitted to produce up to 150 MMgal/yr of final product. The plant generates E85 as well as fuel-grade ethanol. The ethanol may be blended with approximately 2.5% gasoline in the final denaturing stages of the process or it may be left undenatured. Plant construction began in July 2006 and operations began in February 2008. At that time, AE submitted an RMP for the facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nAE is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by AE's investment in accident prevention, through the establishment of a facility that is well designed, installed, operated and maintained. In addition, training is considered a crucial part of safe operation and accident prevention. Staff is trained about spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency response plans in place at the facility. It is AE policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. AE management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and proper emergency response.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nAE is located approximately 0.6 miles south of Lyle, MN and 8.5 miles north of St. Ansgar, Mitchell County, Iowa. The facility is located south of the state line between St. Ansgar, Iowa and Lyle, Mower County Minnesota. \r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The substances which AE has onsite that are regulated by the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant"

      "SummaryText": "(gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  The anhydrous ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process. It is stored in a single anhydrous ammonia tank. The denaturant (gasoline) is used to denature the ethanol so that it is unfit for human consumption before being shipped offsite. Denaturant is stored onsite in the large 188,000 gallon denaturant tank and in a smaller 20,000 gallon gasoline tank.  While the final product storage tanks have the capability to contain denaturant at a maximum concentration of 2.5%, this option has not been used since AE added blending skids at loadout.  Therefore, the final product tanks generally contain undenatured ethanol.      \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe worst case toxic scenario at the facility is the release of 78,795 pounds of anhydrous ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  This worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 3.3 miles from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  Public receptors are located within this radius. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case flammable scenario at the facility is the release of 1,564,363 pounds of denaturant from the entire denaturant tank and both of the final product tanks, creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.9 miles from the denaturant/final product tanks.  Public receptors are also located within the radius.\r\n\r\nAlthough AE has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nSince AE qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has been implemented for this facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition, since the facility qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  The most likely ARS"

      "SummaryText": "for gasoline at AE would be the release of the entire 188,000 gallon denaturant tank.  This would result is the release of 1,129,634 pounds of denaturant, creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.8 miles from the denaturant tank.  Public receptors are located within the radius. The most likely ARS for ammonia is the toxic release of 200 pounds per minute of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.1 miles from the center of the facility.  There are no public receptors within this radius that would be affected by the alternative release.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAE is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3.  AE is fulfilling its duties to comply with the EPA requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.115(d) through the completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  AE has complied with Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. \r\n \r\nThe denaturant tank is equipped with tank level sensors and alarms as well as a bermed containment structure that surrounds the entire tank farm.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with a manual shut off valve.  These chemical specific prevention measures minimize the risk for an RMP reportable incident.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAE has an excellent record of accident prevention. In the last five years, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant that caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to"

      "SummaryText": "our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nAE is registered with the Mason City, IA LEPC and therefore does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support. In the case that an incident occurred which required high level emergency response, AE would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support. \r\n\r\nAs explained above, AE is committed to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations. In the event of a chemical spill, plant personnel would respond to contain the release, as necessary. Some physical aspects of the plant would also help the personnel contain a potential spill. For example, all tanks that contain denaturant are located in a large, bermed containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would be prevented from migrating off-site, and a fire could be extinguished before it spreads to other units at the facility.  In addition, a manual shut off valve in the ammonia tank would help limit the volume of an ammonia spill. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, AE is committed to protecting its employees, the greater community and the environment from the release of hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. AE management is committed to promoting a safe work environment and will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support to operate the ethanol production facility in a safe and efficient manner. Periodic audits will help us assure that we are doing everything reasonable to minimize the risk of and mitigate the effects of an accidental release."
