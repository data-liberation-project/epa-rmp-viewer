      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nWe at Baker Petrolite Corporation (BPC) Sand Springs are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release where to occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of oil-field chemicals. We have seven regulated substances present at our facility that are over the threshold amount. Toxic substances include Aqueous Ammonia, Ethylene Oxide, Formaldehyde 37% solution, Propylene Oxide, and Ethylenediamine. Flammable substances include Isopentane, Isopropylamine, and Propylene.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substances are used in various processes at the facility.  Ammonia and isopropylamine are used in acid neutralization reactions. Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are used in alkyloxylation reactions. Formaldehyde solution is used in the production of resins. Isopentane are used in the production of a pipeline drag reducing agent.  Ethylenediamine is used for resin blends.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. A number of processes at our facility are subject to OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements for the release prevention program that is in place a"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the HAZOP method. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, plant operations, and maintenance. Employees get to make suggestions to improve the safety and environmental operation of their work environment. The analyses are reviewed and revalidated at least every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, BPC-Sand Springs maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address normal operations, including startup, shutdown, and emergency operations. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nBPC-Sand Springs is an ISO 9001 certified facility. This requires the facility to keep up-to-date procedures on all of our operating procedures. There are regular audits from both internal and external auditors.\r\n\r\nTRAINING - BPC-Sand Springs has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Also, in excess of 150 hours per year are spent in operational, safety, and environmental training by every plant employee. This includes offsite fire training where simulations are real and the employee must learn to react quickly to protect himself, his fellow employee, and property from harm. In addition, BPC-Sand Springs has supported and sponsored trainin"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. BPC-Sand Springs also participates in a quarterly leak detection and repair program. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training and experience in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are provided specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nBPC-Sand Springs also has a vessel inspection program that checks the vessel thickness of our reactors on a regular basis. This program was started in September 1998 and has been continuously maintained.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE - Written procedures are in place at BPC-Sand Springs to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at BPC-Sand Springs. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS - BPC-Sand Springs conducts internal audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are underta"

In addition, BPC-Sand Springs is routinely audited by outside parties and Federal and state agencies.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS - BPC-Sand Springs promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective action to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are maintained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - BPC-Sand Springs truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. There is an on-site Safety Committee composed of employee representatives from each plant operating area and chaired by the Site Safety and Health Manager. The committee meets monthly and conducts an audit of a different operations area as part of its activities. Recommended improvements are submitted to the plant manager and monitored by the committee for implementation.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS - On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Baker BPC-Sand Springs has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.

However, there has been one accidental release which resulted in a fatality of an employee.  During this event, there was no significant damage to the property or offsite consequence.  No other accidental releases have occurred which resulted in injury requiring off-site medical care to an employee or an area resident or significant damage to property over this period.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nBPC-Sand Springs maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the emergency plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nBPC-Sand Springs is committed to continuously improving safety at our facility to protect our employees, our community, and the environment.
