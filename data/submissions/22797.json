      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJSC BREWTON, INC.\nBREWTON, ALABAMA MILL\n\n\nBrewton Mill Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the JSC Brewton, Inc., Brewton, Alabama mill to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine dioxide is minimized and if there is a release the offsite consequence will be reduced. To accomplish this the chlorine dioxide process equipment is maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices. Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine dioxide system have been trained in the requirements of chlorine dioxide safety.\n\nDescription of Brewton Mill Operations\n\nThe JSC Brewton, Inc, facility produces a solid bleached sulfate paper and mottled white linerboard. In the process of bleaching pulp chlorine dioxide is utilized. Process water is treated with chlorine dioxide as part of our normal water treatment process.  \n\nDescription of RMP processes:\n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nChlorine dioxide is used for the bleaching of pulp and for the treatment of process water used at the mill. Chlorine Dioxide is manufactured on-site by combining sodium chlorate (NaCLO3), methanol (CH3OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sodium chlorate is reacted under certain conditions of acidity and temperature and with the addition of a reducing agent (methanol) chlorine dioxide is produced. Mill production equipment can produce up to 35 tons per day of a 10 gram per liter (g/L) chlorine dioxide solution, which is stored in two above ground storage tanks. These tanks have a total capacity of 344,000 gallons (172,000 each). \n\nWorst-case release scenario\n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nThe worst-case scenario chosen is the failure of the 172,000 gallon chlorine dioxide storage tank. The chlorine dioxide storage tank catastrophically fails releasing 172,000 gallons (approximately 1,435,400 pounds) of a 1% by weight chlorine dioxide / water solution. The released chlorine dioxide solution is contained within the diked area. The chlorine dioxide in the solution will eva"

The  EPA \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis\"  model predicts that the resulting vapor cloud disperses downwind to a toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L approximately 12 miles from the point of release. \n \nAlternative release scenario\n\nChlorine dioxide \n\nThe alternate release scenario chosen is the failure of the 6-inch diameter chlorine dioxide solution transfer line downstream of the storage tank transfer pumps. The 6-inch diameter transfer line downstream of the storage tank pump fails releasing 536 gallons per minute of chlorine dioxide solution. The operations personnel are assumed to detect and isolate the release within 5 minutes. The released chlorine dioxide solution would be contained within the diked storage tank area. The \"RMP COMP\" model estimated that the resulting vapor cloud disperses downwind to the toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L, approximately 0.9 miles from the point of release.\n\n\nFive-year accidental release history\n\nThere has been one RMP releases of chorine dioxide within the five years of 1994 to date. Note that the accident occurred in a part of the Chlorine Dioxide process that was decommissioned in August 2000.\n\n\nIncident 1 \nDate: May 10, 1997\nTime: 23:00 (approximate)\nDuration of release:  Less than one minute\nChemical Involved: Chlorine Dioxide - CAS 10049-04-4\nEstimated quantity released in pounds: 18 pounds\nType of Release event: Breach of 2 inch liquid line at ground floor level of bleach plant \nWeather Conditions: Not documented\nOn-Site Impacts: Exposure to 3 on-site contractor personnel. No medical treatment required at time of release. One employee was seen by physician 3 days after the incident.\nKnown off-site impacts: No known off-site impacts\nInitiating event and contributing factors: Failure of pipe during start-up following outage.

Use of escape respirators by all personnel in area. Enhancement of procedures for coordination of site hazards with contractors.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nJSC Brewton, Inc., has a OSHA Process Safety Management program in place covering its chlorine dioxide operations. This PSM program meets the requirements of the RMP and is thus utilized as the prevention section of the Brewton facility's RMP.\n\nThe OSHA PSM plan and documentation is maintained in the Technical  Department by the Process Safety / Risk Management Coordinator.\n\nAll sections of the RMP prevention program are covered in the OSHA PSM program.\n    \nEmergency response program\n\nJSC Brewton, Inc.,  mill employees will implement emergency procedures as outlined in the Brewton Mill's Emergency Action Plan and in the Chlorine Dioxide Operating Procedures manual. Mill personnel will handle incidental releases of chlorine dioxide as identified in the mill Emergency Action Plan. Emergency releases of chlorine dioxide will be handled in cooperation with the Brewton Fire Department and local emergency officials. Outside resources such as emergency response contractors will be utilized as necessary based on the severity of the situation. The Brewton Fire Department will be notified by calling 911. The Brewton Fire Department has been informed of the usage of chlorine dioxide and has been provided information on the covered RMP/PSM processes. \n\nInitial response to a 911 call will come from the City of Brewton Fire Department. If the incident requires additional equipment or assistance the Brewton Fire Department will contact additional response agencies such as Escambia County Emergency Management for the needed support.\n\nThe mill has a written Emerg"

This process has eliminated the use of elemental chlorine for our pulp bleaching and treatment of mill process water and replaced our previous R-2 chlorine dioxide process. The Brewton Mill continually looks for opportunities to improve the safety of its operations. This is accomplished through on-going safety audits, safety meetings and preventive maintenance and inspection activities. Opportunities for safety improvement are reviewed and implemented as appropriate. There are no other planned improvements to the new chlorine dioxide process at this time."
