      "SummaryText": "Degussa Construction Chemicals Operations, Inc. of Brighton, Colorado, formerly known as ChemRex, Inc., began production at this location in December of 1997.  It has the primary activity of producing adhesives and caulks for use in the construction industry.  Toluene diisocyanate is the regulated substance stored and used within the plant.\n\nTDI is received in 45,000-pound tank trucks and transferred to a 64,000-pound holding tank within the building.  The handling of TDI in Degussa's processes is completely computer controlled.  Prior to use in manufacturing, TDI is pumped from the bulk storage tank into one of three 2350-pound capacity ?day? tanks.  TDI is then pumped from the ?day? tanks to mixer heads in the intermediate area, reacting and consuming the material.  This \"activation\" procedure is controlled through an Inbatch computer control system which will shut down operations and sound an alarm if outside close tolerances.  \n\nDegussa has specific standard operating procedures and training in the offloading of tankers to bulk storage.  The TDI off-loading SOP specifies that a trained Degussa employee wearing proper PPE will be present during the entire offload procedure, including transfer hose hookup, product transfer, offload and during removal of the transfer hose.  Any leak or rupture will be observed and proper steps taken to shut down transfer to minimize TDI loss.  An isocyanate emergency stop is located at the offload station that automatically stops the offload operation when pressed.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Brighton facility.\n\nDegussa has a comprehensive contingency (emergency response) plan that includes procedures for chemical spills/releases, medical emergencies, natural disasters, and environmental issues.  It identifies the Emergency Coordinator, Team Leaders, and Emergency Response Team members and their responsibilities and training.   It also has procedures for coordinating response with local response agencies\n\nA vent "

      "SummaryText": "was installed in the TDI bulk storage room that would minimize the build-up of TDI vapors and decrease the potential for release of vapors into other areas of the facility in the event of a small leak within the room.  The TDI day-tank room has an active exhaust that passes through a carbon scrubber before being vented out of the facility.  Sensor systems were installed in the bulk storage and \"day-tank\" storage that monitor TDI levels in the rooms.  Remote displays allow employees to check for levels of TDI down to 0.2 parts per billion prior to entering the storage areas.  If levels rise above 5 ppb, the building security company will receive an alarm and notify our facility contact.  Our maintenance department has a preventative maintenance program which includes critical TDI safety and testing equipment."
