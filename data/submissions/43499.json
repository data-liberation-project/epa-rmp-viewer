RMPComp software was used, in Revision 2, to conduct the modeling for Cyclohexylamine, Monoisopropylamine and Dimethylamine.  \n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) developed the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n       Five-year accident history\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n\nDelta Terminal Services (Jefferson) is regulated under Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n       The facility stores monoisopropylamine (MIPA), Dimethylamine (DMA) and Cyclohexylamine (CHA) in excess of the threshold quanitites.\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public Receptor (residence).\n       It is subject to the OSHA PSM rule.\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115, Delta Terminal Services (Jefferson) stores more than the threshold quantity of monoisopropylamine (IPA)(5,000 lbs.); Dimethylamine (MIPA)(10,000 lbs) and Cyclohexylamine (CHA)(15,000 lbs.).  \n\nTherefore, Delta Terminal Services (Jeffers"

      "SummaryText": "on) is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Delta Terminal Services (Jefferson) receives railcar and tank truck shipments of MIPA and IPA, the largest of which can store approximately 155,000 lbs. at any one time.  Currently, 55 gallon drums of Cyclohexylamine are part of the filling operation but are received full for storage in the warehouse.  However, a worse case and alternate release for CHA is addressed in this Revision 2.   \n\nDelta Terminal Services is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. Employees involved in operating monoisopropylamine, dimethylamine and cyclohexylamine activities are thoroughly trained to identify and understand the hazards posed by this the transfer process.  Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically reviewed.  Materials include information pertaining to the hazards of the aforementioned products, process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures.\n \nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program applicability.  Delta Terminal Services had previously chosen to use the U.K. HSE TNT Equivalency Method  to determine the distance to an overpressure to determine offsite impacts. However RMPComp is used in Revision 2 to determine offsite ipacts.\n\nThe facility maintains written process safety information to enable employees involved in handling these chemicals to identify and understand the hazards posed by this process. Written information includes physical properties, health risks associated, and material safety data sheets."
