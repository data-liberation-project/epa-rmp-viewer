This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at LyondellBasell La Porte. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \nLyondellBasell La PorteA?s primary activities encompass olefins, and polymer and resins manufacturing.

Members of the Emergency Response Team (ERT) undergo training that includes classroom and on-the-job training as well as regular emergency drills. A highly trained and confident ERT can limit damage during an emergency event, but more importantly prompt emergency response can prevent more serious accidents from occurring. Our teams regularly attend some of the best training programs available, in particular, the programs conducted at Texas A&M University.\n\n"
