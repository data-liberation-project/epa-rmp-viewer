This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures inhibiting microbiological growth.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used  refrigerants in the food industry and is the most effective and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food at its proper temperature.  It is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  The refrigeration system at Sunny Fresh Foods controls the temperature of product in holding tanks, pasteurizing, cooler and blast freezer warehouse, production rooms and entree freezers in Further Processing.\n\nSunny Fresh Foods has calculated a worst case scenario involving a failure of our high pressure receiver causing 2200 pounds of ammonia to be released over 10 minutes.  This would have a predicted impact of six tenths of a mile and potentially affect 220 people and small businesses around the Sunny Fresh Lake Odessa, MI plant.  An alternative scenario would be a failure of a valve resulting in a release of 1300 pounds over 10 minutes.  This would have a predi"
