We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management acitivities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n* The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\r\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nOur facility produces chlorinated dry bleaches which are used extensively as sanitizers and disinfectants in detergents, cleansers, water treatment, and swimming pool and spa water treatment. The manufacture of our products utilizes a variety of chemicals and processing operations. One of our primary raw materials is chlorine, which EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. Chlorine is the only chemical at the Clearon Corp that is classified as a hazardous chemical. Manufacturing Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule. Chlorine is received in railroad tank cars and the maximum inventory at the site is 1,260,000 pounds. The inventory of chlorine is kept as low as practicable and the normal inventory is much less than the maximum level which is on"

The plant has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management Planning organization with management systems in place to ensure that all elements of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations are followed. All new facilities are subject to thorough hazard reviews during design, construction and startup utilizing a program called \"Safety in Engineering, Technology, Construction, and Operations\" (SETCO). This program is intended to eliminate or mitigate any possible releases of hazardous chemcials in the workplace or environment. The entire chlorine process was studied during a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) led by one of the leading U.S. process safety consulting companies in 1997. \r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chlorine-specific prevention steps to address the scenarios given above.\r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenario:\r\n* Movement of chlorine cars within the facility is highly controlled by both plant personnel and railroad personnel.\r\n* The chlorine unloading station is isolated from other operations, thereby reducing exposure to fire or accidents. Cars positioned at the unloading station are protected by derail switches and monitored by video surveillance cameras.\r\nAlternate release scenario:\r\n* The chlorine unloading area is monitored by video surveillance cameras, periodic personnel inspections, and equipped with a number of highly sensitive chlorine detection instruments with alarms.\r\n* A computerized operating system automatically monitors the chlorine system at all times.\r\n* The chlorine unloading system is equipped with automatic shutoff valves that can be activated from three separate locations.\r\n* The system is equipped with pressure relief valves, which will vent chlorine to a scrubb"
