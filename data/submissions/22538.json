Accidental release prevention and Emergency response policies\nIn this facility, we use isobutane and ethane, which are considered flammable by the EPA. The same properties that make isobutane and ethane valuable as blowing agents in our manufacturing processes also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling them. These precautions are in place to prevent the unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the treat to our personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the treat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle isobutane, and ethane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees help insure the safety of our employees and our community. Our emergency response program is meant to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Law (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act). FP International's response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2) Stationary source and regulated substance handled\nA) At our Hopkinsville facility, FP International uses polyethylene in manufacturing our product. During the Cushion-Lite process a mixture of ethane and isobutane blowing agents are injected into a polyethylene melt as it is extruded. One 14,193-gallon isobutane above ground storage tank and two 5,000-gallon ethane storage trailers are used to separately store the blowing agents. \nB) The regulated substance handled at this facility is ethane and isobutane. \nC) The maximum amount stored at this facility 86,220 pounds. \n\n\n3. Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternate release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation mea"

      "SummaryText": "sures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\nRMP Comp used for modeling.\nA) Worst Case Scenario:\nA failure of the largest 14,193-gallon above ground isobutane storage tank when filled with the greatest amount allowed would release 56,520 pounds of isobutane. Per NFPA policy we limit the maximum filling capacity of each tank to 85% at 60 degrees F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, which results in a vapor cloud explosion. \nThe distance to the end point of 1 psi for the worst case scenario is 0.3 miles.\n\nB)  Alternative scenario: \nA pull away causing failure of a 25' length hose on the 14,193-gallon above ground isobutane storage tank would release 1,410 pounds of isobutane. The manually operated shut off valve will stop the flow of isobutane. Although it is unlikely, if the vapor reaches an ignition source it would result in a vapor cloud fire.\nThe estimated distance to lower flammability limit is < 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n4) General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\nThis manufacturing facility complies with the EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and with all applicable State Codes and Regulations. This facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58and NFPA - 30.\nAs part of our Corporate Injury Illness and Prevention Plan all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to the training received upon initial training, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job which exposes them to new hazards. Our Corporate Hazard Communication Plan, which is located in our safety manual contains, safe work practices, the use and care of personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases.
