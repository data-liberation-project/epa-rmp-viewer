Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Berne Coop (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n    Anhydrous Ammonia is stored at the facility in one 30,000 gallon and one 26,000 gallon \n    storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous ammonia stored would be \n238,000 pounds.  Propane is stored at a separate site in one 12,000 gallon storage tank and one 300 gallon tank. It is used for grain drying.  The maximum quantity of propane stored is 38,680 pounds. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \nreleased as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would \nbe 127,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 \npercent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point \n(point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles.  \n    The worst case scenario for propane is the maximum quantity being released is 37,740     pounds. The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure)is .3 miles. \n\nb.The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \nThe distance"

The active mitigation \n    devices are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the contents of \n    the hose. The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds. The distance to the \n    end point (point of 1psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58. The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane\nin the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property \ndamage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, \ninjuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and \n    community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, incl"
