It is intended to prevent and limit the impact of potentially toxic and flammable substances from being accidentally released by the refinery. The RMP includes a facility-wide review of potential hazards, a worst-case, alternative case and off-site consequences analysis, and implements a formal management system for managing and minimizes those risks.   The RMP is just one element of HIE's commitment to safety and protection of employees, the surrounding community and environment.\n\n\n\nSafety Commitment\n\n\n\nThe following corporate policy statement expresses HIE 's overall commitment to safety and the prevention of accidental releases which could impact the community.  \n\n\n\nHawaii Independent Energy considers safety an integral part of its performance.  At HIE we believe:\n\n?    All accidents can be prevented.\n\n?    Safety is not to be compromised for any reason.\n\n?    Each employee is responsible for their own safety and working safely is a condition of employment.\n\n?    Management is accountable for accident prevention\n\n?    Trained employees are an essential element for safe workplaces.\n\n?    All operating exposures can be safeguarded.\n\n?    Immediate corrective action shall be taken on all unsafe practices and incidents with injury or damage potential. \n\n\n\nComplying with the requirements of OSHA's Process Management System (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) will help protect employees as well as the surrounding communities and environment. \n\n\n\n\n\nRefinery Process Description\n\n\n\nHawaii Independent Energy operates a petroleum refinery in the Campbell Industrial Park. The refinery is rated to process 95,000 barrels per day of crude oil into jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, asphalt, fuel oil, propane and butane.  No petrochemicals are produced.

      "SummaryText": "rocesses there are no toxic substances stored on-site which exceed the threshold quantities established under 40 CFR 68.   However, as might be expected, 8 out of 15 refinery processes have the potential to contain more than 10,000 lbs. of flammable mixtures.  Most of the flammable substances, such as feedstocks, motor fuels and LPG are stored in the refinery's tank farm.  Other refinery processes have flammable substances held principally in process vessels and interconnecting piping.  The 8 refinery processes described below are subject to the containment and control measures mandated by the refinery's RMP for flammable mixtures.\n\n1.    Tank Farm:  The Tank Farm (TKF) contains many petroleum storage tanks,  including vertical tanks, pressurized horizontal tanks (bullets) and one sphere.  Stored products include crude oil, fuel oils, diesel, kerosene, gasoline, naphtha, , butane and propane. The amount of flammable substances subject to RMP was based on the tanks' capacity to store naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas LPG. The RMP flammable inventory excludes crude oil, gasoline and mixtures which are heavier than gasoline.  LPG, principally butane and propane, is stored in 8 pressurized tanks which have deluge systems in case of fire.  All vertical tanks are diked to contain releases.  Foam is also available for tank fires.     \n\n\n\n2.    Crude Distillation and Vacuum Unit:  Crude oil is washed to remove salt, heated and then distilled in the  atmospheric distillation tower  referred to as the crude distillation unit (CDU) into naphtha, kerosene, diesel, atmospheric gas oils (middle distillates), and residual oil . The heavier oils from the CDU are further processed by vacuum distillation (VDU).  Although the CDU and VDU can be operated independently, normally both units work in conjunction with one another. The CDU contains more than 10,000 lbs. of flammable material.  The VDU does not but for the purposes of RMP, and given the physical and operation interconnectivity be"

      "SummaryText": "tween the two units, the CDU and VDU were treated as a single covered process. Likewise, the VDU was included in the CDU HAZOP which was conducted for PSM and RMP .  The naphtha and other light ends coming off the top of the atmospheric tower are covered by the RMP as a flammable mixture.  The hazards associated with the CDU include high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, and chemicals such as caustic used to treat the kerosene.  The CDU also contains the sour water stripper (SWS).  Steam is used in the SWS to strip ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from water containing ammonium hydrosulfide.  The H2S and NH3 are sent to the Sulfur Recovery Units discussed below.\n\n\n\n3.    Visbreaker and Offgas Hydrotreater:  The heavy residual oils from the bottom of the VDU tower are processed in the Visbreaker (VBK) by viscosity breaking at high temperature.  This results in breakdown of the heavy oil to produce fuel gas, naphtha and lighter oils.  The hazards associated with this process are again high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, gases containing ~10% H2S. For the purposes of the RMP the greatest concern is with the release and subsequent ignition of flammable mixtures.

By permit condition the two units must be operated in conjunction with one another.\n\n\n\n4.    Distillate Hydrocracker:  In the hydrocracker (DHC), gas oils from the CDU and VDU are mixed with hydrogen and sent to a series of catalytic reactors where nitrogen and sulfur are removed and the oils are cracked and reacted with hydrogen to form diesel, kerosene, naphtha and lighter gaseous products.  Some of the reactions in these reactors are exothermic and the potential exists for a runaway reaction.  Process controls minimize this possibility and provide for rapid pressure reduction by de-pressuring the reactors to the flare to protect against accidents.  Following the"

Additional hazards include H2S and NH3 up to 5% in some gaseous streams, high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, and flammable mixtures.\n\n\n\n5.    Amine Treatment Unit:  In the ATU, H2S in gaseous and liquid petroleum (LPG) hydrocarbon streams is absorbed using and amine solutions.  The H2S rich amine is then stripped using steam producing a sour gas (90+% H2S stream) that is sent to the sulfur recovery unit. Although the amount of H2S never approaches 10,000 pounds, HIE considers the H2S to present a significant risk, and treats it accordingly.  H2S ambient monitors are strategically placed to pick up any release.  This process unit also includes the LPG Merox Unit where mercaptans are removed with caustic (NaOH).  in addition to the normal hazards of high temperature and pressure large amounts of LPG are present in ATU and as a consequence the ATU is subject to the provisions of the Chemical Accident Prevention program .\n\n\n\n6.    Light Ends Recovery Unit:  The LERU is a collection of four fractionating columns designed to separate and purify the lighter products for sale or reuse.  Methane and ethane are used as fuel gas, butane and iso-pentane are used for gasoline blending, and propane is sold separately.  There are no fired heaters in this unit.  The unit contains large amounts of light flammable hydrocarbons in addition to the hazards of high temperature and pressure. \n\n\n\n7.    Hydrotreating and Reforming Unit:  This covered process includes the naphtha hydrotreater (NHT) where sulfur and nitrogen are removed from the naphtha using hydrogen at high temperature and pressure.

The hydrogen generated in the CRU is used in the DHC.    \n\n\n\n8.    Flare System:  The refinery flare serves an emergency relief device for the process units described above. The flare system consists of the various flare headers throughout the process areas and two knockout drums.  The flare system transports gases from pressure safety relief valves to the flare for safe combustion.  There is little potential for fire or explosion because the flare operates at very low pressures and is itself a control device.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on engineering review, the seven processes listed below do not have flammable mixtures or contain toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantities established by 40 CFR 68. Although these processes are not specifically regulated under 40 CFR 68, the following processes, along with the rest of the refinery are managed according to the refinery's PSM program which embodies many of the same elements as RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.    Sulfur Recovery Units/Tail Gas Unit:  The SRU receives acidic gases (NH3 and H2S) principally from the SWS and the ATU. The feed gases to the SRU are, for all practical purposes, void of hydrocarbon and generally are not characterized as a flammable mixture.   Ammonia is thermally decomposed and the H2S is converted to sulfur and removed.  The molten sulfur is condensed, prilled and sold.  The Sulfur Recovery Plant (SRP) also includes the Shell Claus Offgas Treater (SCOT) or Tail Gas Treating (TGU) is used to remove residual sulfur compounds from the flue or tail gas of the SRU.  A tail gas incinerator provides the final control.  Internal burners are fired on hydrogen and the incinerator is fired on refinery fuel gas.\n\n\n\n2.

Asphalt Heating and Loading:  In 2006 the refinery suspended the process producing asphalt by air blowing in the Asphalt Manufacturing Unit (AMU).  The asphalt oxidizer (R801) as known as the air blower and the waste gas incinerator (H802) were taken out-of-service.  Aside from the asphalt loading rack which is used to fill trucks and inter-island container , there is a refinery fuel gas-fired heater which is used to keep asphalt warm so that is can be pumped and transferred.   \n\n\n\n4.    Cogeneration Unit:  The CGU consists of a combustion turbine power generating unit combined with a waste heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  In addition to jet fuel the CGU was designed to and for a number of years was fired on light fuel such as naphtha and reformate. That practice was suspended in 2006. After completing a project to reduce risk associated with firing on light fuel, (and after substantial repairs were made to turbine) on May 29, 2011 the practice of firing naphtha (as the primary fuel) was resumed. The naphtha, which originates from the crude unit, passes through the northernmost of three pressurized horizontal tanks (Bullet 2301A). (The other two are currently empty)  The naphtha that passes through the bullet is first stabilized, and its initial boiler point (IBP) is more than 100 F, as verified by lab testing.  Consequently the naphtha which is stored in the bullet carries a NFPA fire rating of 3 and is not regulated as a flammable substance or mixture under 40 CFR 68. The cogeneration unit is also equipped with a duct burner which is fired exclusively on refinery fuel gas. Since there really is no storage of the refinery fuel gas prior to its use, the maximum i"

The is no storage of fuel gas with the steam generating system as results, the amount (7500 lbs.) of fuel gas contained in the lines leading up to the boilers is less than the 10,000 lb. threshold.  \n\n\n\n6.    Wastewater Treatment Unit:  The wastewater treatment unit (WTU) receives oily waste water from the refinery process units.  The WTU separates oil from water wastewater and also strips dissolved hydrocarbons (principally benzene) from the wastewater, prior to bio-treatment in the activated sludge unit.  Liquid hydrocarbons are stored in a recovered oil tank and recycled back into the refining process.  Potentially flammable hydrocarbon vapors contained in the head space of various tanks and vessels in the WTU are routed to a closed vent system and in a thermal oxidizer.     The potential for vapors and the flammability risk is limited because the CO2 or nitrogen are normally introduced into the head space to provide an inert gas blanket. Although light liquid hydrocarbons are recovered from the wastewater and temporarily stored in tanks, this recovered oil does not meet the NFPA flammable criteria and thus the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity is not exceeded.  The change in the inventory amounts was based on a more exacting applicability analysis, not a process change.     \n\n\n\n7.    Fuel Treatment Plant:  The fuel treatment plant (FTP) is used principally to remove impurities from fuel oil, which is routinely sold to a large independent Cogeneration Facility which borders the refinery.  There are no fired heaters used in this process.  Treatment of the fuel oil in the FTP does not involve the use of flammable compounds under either the RMP or PSM definition.\n\n\n\nFlammable Mixtures: The refinery produces flammable mixtures as part of its main business "

In addition the inventory includes naphtha, which can occasionally exceed the RMP flammability criteria for mixtures.  The inventory and threshold for flammable substances inventory determinations does not include crude oil, or gasoline.  Although gasoline contains components such as butane and pentane, which are specifically listed as regulated flammable substances, the combination of these substances along with other hydrocarbons form a mixture (gasoline) which does not meet the NFPA 4 flammable criteria. More specifically gasoline does not normally meet both of the following criteria: flash point less than 73 F and boiling point less than 100 F.  Similarly products and intermediates which are heavier than gasoline are not included in the RMP inventory, even though products (such as diesel, jet and kerosene) would be consider flammable or combustible under other regulations or standards.   \n\n\n\nThe great majority RMP flammable mixtures are stored in the tank farm.

Since these toxics substances are processed rather than stored they do not exceed the threshold quantities that would cause the units through which they are processed or treated to be considered a process covered by RMP.  However the release of all hazards substances have been fully addressed through the refinery's safety program and potential release scenarios have been analyzed and mitigation measures taken.  Preventative and mitigation measures for these releases are addressed in HIE's PSM program and Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios (Worst Case and Alternatives)\n\n\n\nUnder the Chemical Accident Prevention regulations, if any process stores toxic or flammable substance above EPA's threshold quantities, the refinery must determine the worst-case accidental release (defined as the release resulting in the greatest downwind impact) for that substance. Only a very limited subset of mitigation measures may be considered in projecting the impact of a worst-case scenario.  While EPA strictly defines the worst-case scenario, alternative cases that may be more likely to occur may be presented, and are used as the basis for conducting emergency response drills.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Scenario: The worst-case scenario would involve the release, dispersion and ultimately and explosion a 30,000 gallon butane bullet in the LPG storage area (in the SW Tank Farm), if filled to 85.5% (safe fill level).  Although the butane is less than 99% pure and consequently is classified as a flammable mixture for the purposes of RMP, it was modeled as all butane for the offsite consequences analysis.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes the entire contents of the bullet (25,650 gallons) are released as a gas in less than 10 minutes and is then involved in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).

The Kalealoa cogeneration plant receives fuel oil produced by the Facility's FTP directly by a dedicated pipeline. \n\n\n\nEven in a worst-case scenario, there are no nearby residences that could be impacted.  Likewise, no sensitive environmental receptors would be impacted under the worst-case scenario.  The public receptors are commercial enterprises and offices located closest to the refinery.

For example, LPG storage area has a deluge system on it to mitigate the effects of a fire.  The vessel is also isolated and inspected and tested according to industry standards to prevent failure.    \n\n\n\nThe First Alternative Case:  The first alternative-case scenario would be the same as the worst-case scenario, but considers if the tank contents were propane rather than butane.

This second alternative case was represented by a two inch hole or line connection from a 30,000 gallon propane (C3) bullet also located in the LPG storage area, if filled to 85.5% (safe fill level).   Utilizing a combination EPA Offsite Consequences Analysis calculation and the Aloha model (which is endorsed by the EPA), the vapor cloud is expected to be blown (by winds which are assumed to be 3 meters per second) 402 feet from the point of release .  Subsequent ignition and explosion of the cloud could cause an impact an additional 477 feet away.  Consequently the total hazard distance for the alternative case was estimated at 879 ft (0.17 miles).    \n\n\n\nThe Third Alternative Case:  At recommendation of a third party auditor a third alternative case was analyzed based on the possibility of a release for a pressurized tanker truck while parked or offloading in the propane load rack. The PLR is at the south eastern edge of the facilities property line.  To conservatively determine the worst case in the event of propane from this location, the entire 100 bbl pressurized tanker truck or container, if filled to 85.5% (safe fill level), was assumed to be release and ignite and create a VCE.
