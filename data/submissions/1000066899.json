Arkalon Ethanol, LLC is permitted to manufacture up to 121 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year. The anniversary date of the most recent resubmission of the RMP was November 27, 2012, and this document is being submitted to update information related to activities at the plant since the last resubmission. The last resubmission was the 5-year update to the initial RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nArkalon has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nArkalon has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nArkalon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Arkalon is Richard Hanson, Plant Manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individual (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telep"

The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to manufacture fuel-grade or industrial ethanol from corn. The regulated substance under the RMP program is natural gasoline (denaturant). Pentane is the single largest constituent within Arkalon's denaturant, and was selected as the entire contents of the flammable liquid for RMP purposes.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model result was a 0.8 mile radius, and is provided as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility's knowledge of nearby residences. A ditch is located to the east of the facility. This ditch flows southeast toward the Garden City Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is within the worst-case distance to endpoint for denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\n\n\n1.

      "SummaryText": "ve scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility only occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member in the control room overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end-point; the model results were <0.1 miles, and the model output is also included as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility's knowledge of nearby residences. The population was estimated using a 0.25 mile distance to endpoint as CAPS did not have data for 0.1 miles. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nThe Arkalon facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the presence of the flammable liquid that is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nArkalon's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations.
