Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMainas Farms conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMainas Farms uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Sheets R1.0 and R2.0 in Appendix A2 of the RMP Binder located at the facility show the facility location map, site plan and equipment layouts.\n\nThe facility has three cold rooms (Raw Product Cooler, Processing Room, and Palletizing Room) and two refrigerated loading docks (Docks 1 & 2). The facility is composed of both portable and fixed refrigeration systems. The fixed equipment includes 32 air-cool evaporators located throughout the cold rooms and docks, two recirculator packages with vessel and two ammonia pumps, ammonia sensors, piping and refrigeration controls. The fixed system is connected to two portable re"

The equipment located on the refrigeration trailers include two evaporative condensers, one high-pressure receiver, one suction accumulator, and two screw compressors. The trailers and ammonia charge of the system is removed from the site at the end of each season.\n\nAll the compressors have safety switches that will shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and the compressor are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves.\n\nRefrigeration drawings are located in Appendix A2-System Drawings in the RMP Binder. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Equipment List located in Appendix F of the RMP Binder.  International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A1 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for this system is shown in Section V.A.2 in the RMP Binder. The total refrigeration charge of approximately 13,750 lb is completely sealed and pressurized within the system\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A4 in the RMP Binder for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.

There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation in the RMP Binder.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Mainas Farms personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N in the RMP Binder.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potent"

The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.
