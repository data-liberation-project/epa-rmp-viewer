These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals.  The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety as well as environmental protection.\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that, Iowa Quality Meats is complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation, Title 29 Code of the Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program Regulation (RMP), Title 40 Code of the Federal Regulation Part 68. These regulations deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fire, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs are in place to prevent potential accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage.\n\nThese safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels that are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary.  All information is communic"
