This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance chlorine used  for water disinfection.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Toa Vaca Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nToa Vaca Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plant supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine is delivered from the San Juan Warehouse and Distribution Center to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Toa Vaca Filtration Plant could have a storage maximum volume of 18,000 pounds distributed in nine (9) containers.  The containers are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the ejectors and then the chlorine solution is sent to one (1) disinfection point along the process of the plant. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.

Using Marplot and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 5,607 public receptors are inside the 1.3 miles radio.  Toa Vaca and Guayabal Lakes are within the 1.3 miles radio,  environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) were identified within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a valve rupture.  Using the Marplot and the US Cenus 2010 it was identified 31 public receptors inside the 0.2 miles radio.  On recent aerial photographs, several houses and a church are observed adjacent to the Toa Vaca Filtration Plant.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) are already in place to comply with OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOPs are indicated in the PSM document located in the plant.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics event"
