We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Du Bois Terminal located in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania is owned by Enterprise Terminals and Storage, LLC and is operated by Enterprise.  \n\n\n\nThe Du Bois Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline and is stored in an above ground storage tank.  The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tank into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.\n\n\n\nThe process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 fac"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Propane is the only listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Du Bois Terminal.  Ethyl mercaptan is also in storage and use at the terminal, but is present in storage below the threshold quantity.   \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Du Bois Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Du Bois Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previou"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Du Bois Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms in the storage , loading and dehydration areas\n\n* Flame detectors in the storage, loading and dehydration areas\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high flow).\n\n* Secondary containment to contain any release of liquid ethyl mercaptan.\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n\n* Storage tank internal emergency shut down and excess flow valves\n\n* Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers \n\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, flame retardant coveralls, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, \n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nThe Du Bois Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the"

The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Du Bois Terminal is coordinated with the Clearfield County Emergency Management organization, which serves as the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Du Bois Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Du Bois Terminal conducts periodic site orientations and emergency response briefings for emergency response organizations.  The Du Bois Terminal also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Du Bois Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Du Bois Terminal.\n\n\n\n* No planned changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
