      "SummaryText": "I. INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Background\n\nBodycote Thermal Processing (BODYCOTE), 284 Grove Street, Worcester, MA processes a wide range of steel and alloy metal products in heat treating furnaces to harden the material to customer specifications.  As part of its heat treating processes, BODYCOTE uses anhydrous ammonia gas a reactant.  The nitrogen component of the ammonia gas penetrated the outer layer of the metal being treated in a furnace and the reaction serves to harden the metal.  The residual ammonia and gaseous by-products from this process in the furnace are typically flared off.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is one of the toxic substances that is subject to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (40 CFR 68).  These regulations require a subject facility to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) when a listed substance is handled, stored, manufactured, or used in certain quantities.  The RMP threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  Since BODYCOTE has an anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a maximum capacity of 52,328 pounds at its facility, it is required to have a Risk Management Plan.  No other chemical at BODYCOTE exceeds the RMP thresholds of applicability.\n\nII. BODYCOTE'S RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nBODYCOTE's Risk Management Plan, of which this Executive Summary is a part, complies with the specific requirements in EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) for Program 3 processes.\n\nA. RMP* Submit Data Elements\n\nThe files submitted to EPA during September, 2004 include the data elements completed using EPA's RMP* submit and RMP COMP programs.  Please refer to the RMP* Submit files for the complete submittal made to EPA.\n\nB. Chemical Safety and Prevention\n\nAnhydrous ammonia requires proper storage and handling precautions to prevent exposures to co-workers, neighbors, and the environment in the day-to-day use of ammonia and in the event of an accidental release.  It is BODYCOTE's goal to meet or exceed, where possible, all stat"

As such, the management at BODYCOTE has implemented numerous measures to prevent, mitigate, and respond to accidental release of ammonia at the facility.\n\nAt BODYCOTE, managing the risks and hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia begins with the employees.  It is BODYCOTE's policy that only trained, experienced Lindurea and Nitriding Process Technicians operate the associated equipment.  Furthermore, all employees are encouraged to make recommendations to further ensure safe handling of ammonia.\n\nA review of past deliveries of anhydrous ammonia indicates that typically 15 tons (30,000 pounds) is delivered when the storage tank volume approaches 10% (about 5,500 pounds).  With this historical perspective BODYCOTE has limited deliveries of ammonia to not exceed 15 tons (30,000 lbs) by including it in the Process Hazard Analysis section of its process safety amangement (PSM) plan as an administrative control.  As a practical matter BODYCOTE's Purchasing Department will limit deliveries accordingly.  With this control in place BODYCOTE will be able to reduce the quantity of ammonia on site from a maximum tank capacity of 52,328 pounds to no more than 40,000 pounds thereby reducing the area of toxic endpoint in a worst-case scenario.  \n\nThe installation, inspection protocol and routine maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia storage and supply system at BODYCOTE are in accordance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI K61.1-1999), Compressed Gas Association (CGA G2.1-1999) and OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111) guidelines and recommendations.\n\nAnother key aspect of BODYCOTE's prevention program is its compliance with OSHA's PSM plan.  The PSM Plan includes a Hazard Analysis that identifies problems that may lead to a release and/or exposure to ammonia, and rectifies the problem.  PSM Plan also evaluates training, maintenance, management of change, and inspection activities related to proper use, stora"

Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes configuring a given release scenario (e.g., worst-case) and predicting the maximum distance to the edge of the impact area (called the \"zone of impact\").  CAPACCIO used guidance from EPA to define the release scenarios for the alternative release and the worst-case release.  CAPACCIO used the RMP COMP program to estimate the distance to the Toxic Endpoint for the release scenarios. \n\nThe concentration of ammonia that defines the zone of impact is based on EPAs Exhibit B1 Data for Toxic Gasses.  The endpoint represents a safe level of exposure \"below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.\"  The endpoint for ammonia is 200 parts per million in ambient air.\n\nPer changes in EPA submittal requirements (40 CFR 68.155), a summary of the potential release scenarios is not included in the Executive Summary.\n\nD. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn spite of the fact that BODYCOTE has never had an ammonia release, BODYCOTE has prepared a \"Process Safety Management Plan\" to ensure rapid response in the event of an accidental release. In the event of an emergency that may potentially impact the community, the Worcester Police Department will notify residents and businesses."
