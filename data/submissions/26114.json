If an accidental release\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Welton Fire Department,    \n Clinton Co. Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.\t  The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at, Welton                    is the storage\nand blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored,\nand distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \nhandling system consists of 2-12,000  gallon storage tanks, loading risers\nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized \nfacility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be  234,000             \npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.\t  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be   56,000         \npounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance of the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is .74  miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release \nfrom a break in a transfer hose.  Emergency shutdown procedures, which include the \nclosing of tank valves if possible, otherwise excess flow valves was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amo"
