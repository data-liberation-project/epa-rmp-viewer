If changes occur, retraining may be required.\n\n*  Mechanical integrity - We have an active dedicated professional responsible for MI program\n\n*  Management of change - MOC procedure is used for any change in the covered processes of the plant. ASRC recently began using an electronic software program for MOCs, action items, PSSRs, etc. to track, communicate, train, etc. \n\n*  Pre-startup review - Any time their is an MOC or process shutdown, PSSRs are completed as described in the ASRC procedures.\n\n*  Compliance audits - ASRC hires a third independent party to conduct the compliance every 3 years.  Additionally the regulatory agency performs a compliance audit every 3 years. \n\n*  Incident investigation - Conducted after any major incident in the covered process areas\n\n*  Employee participation - ASRC utilizes employees in PHAs, PSSRs, audits, MOCs, etc per the written instruction.\n\n*  Hot work permit - A robust hot work permit has been defined and is used\n\n*  Contractor evaluation and screening - Contractor evaluation is completed prior to hiring and issues are resolved or the contractor is replaced.\n\n",

Non - bulk raw material receipts (drum /carton commodities) are generally received via common carrier. Facilities for receiving and storage of the more volatile process materials are located outdoors in areas as remote as practical from the main plant processes. These installations are typically protected and provided with a means of secondary containment (e.g. dikes) in order to minimize hazards resulting from spillage. The physical transfer of raw materials from transport container to storage and on to the various processing units is accomplished by means of pumps and/or inert gas pressure.    \n\n\n\nBR and SSBR, reaction products of butadiene and butadiene / styrene respectively, are manufactured in a continuous polymerization process utilizing either toluene or cyclohexane/ methylcyclohexane solvent as a diluent. Organometallic catalysts are added to initiate the reaction and carry it to the desired level of conversion. The resulting polymer solution is then pumped through a series of flash distillation units to recover and eventually reuse the unreacted butadiene and a significant portion of the solvent, leaving a more viscous solution.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the remaining solvent is then separated (stripped) from the polymer using a steam distillation process. This occurs by bringing the polymerized rubber into contact with hot water and steam. Stripped vapors arising from this operation are condensed and recovered for reuse.
