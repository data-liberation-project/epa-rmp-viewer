To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, Rayonier uses four chemicals subject the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Fernandina Mill is classified as NAICS Code 32211 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\n2. Chlorine\n3. Chlorine dioxide\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process. \nThe current quantity of chlorine dioxide reported in this update for the chlorine dioxide covered process is significantly lower than the reported quantity in the previous RMP submissions. This change is the result of the exclusion of the chlorine dioxide inventory in the unit\u00bfs main storage tank.  The concentration of chlorine dioxide in the main storage tank is 0.8% or 8 ppm chlorine dioxide. This concentration is below the 1.0% minimum level specified in the RMP regulation. The 1009 pounds of chlorine dioxide reported in this update represents the calculated quantity of chlorine dioxide in the mill\u00bfs ClO2 generators. The generator system produces ClO2 at concentrations above 1% and the contents are subject to the RMP regulation.\n\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nReporting requirement removed. \n\n\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill is subject to both EPA and OSHA process safety management regulations.

Additionally, the mill identifies and addresses opportunities to further improve safety performance at the mill through comprehensive internal and third party audits aimed at process safety program elements. The following 12 sections provide a brief description of the Mill\u00bfs management systems to address the program 3 accident prevention provisions of the EPA\u00bfs RMP regulation.\n\n1.4.1   Process Safety Information\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill has compiled written Process Safety Information (PSI) before conducting any process hazard analysis as required by the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The PSM standard requirements for PSI are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.65.  This compilation of written process safety information enables Rayonier and the employees involved in operating the processes to identify and understand the possible hazards posed by those processes involving toxic substances.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the toxic substances used in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.\n\nPSI has been collected and updated for Rayonier's four RMP process systems: ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Material Data Safety Sheets (MSDS), block flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams (P & IDs), and equipment information are stored in the PSM Information books, drawings, and equipment files.\n\n1.4.2    Process Hazard Review\n\nRayonier\u00bfs Fernandina Performance Fibers Mill has performed an initial Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) on all four covered processes as well as periodic analyses as required by the PSM/RMP regulations.  The PSM standard requirements for PHAs are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.67.  Initial PHAs were completed by May 1997 for Rayonier\u00bfs f"

      "SummaryText": "er's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill already has a mechanical integrity system in place due to the requirements of PSM.  Under the RMP rule 40 CFR 68.73, Rayonier has adopted this mechanical integrity system.  The system ensures that the process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases.  It includes written procedures, training, inspection, and testing, correcting system deficiencies and quality assurance.  These tasks are discussed further in the PSM Mechanical Integrity manual.\n\n\n1.4.6    Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is in place at Rayonier to prevent changes in the process and supporting equipment from introducing unacceptable hazards to workers.  This MOC system has written procedures for managing changes to be made to a PSM/RMP covered process.  The procedures require review prior to the change with a special emphasis on safety and training of employees and contractors.  Process Safety Information (PSI) and procedures are updated when a change is made. \n\n\n1.4.7    Pre-Startup Review\n\nPrior to starting up any new covered process or modified covered process, Rayonier performs a pre-startup safety review when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  This review ensures all requirements are met before the introduction of any highly hazardous chemical into a new or modified process.  This review is done before startup to verify that safety issues have been addressed. This final pre-startup review aids in ensuring that changes in the system are properly installed and tested before startup.  \n\n\n1.4.8    Compliance Audits\n\nAt least every three years, Rayonier evaluates the effectiveness of the PSM/RMP system.  Audits are performed to determine that the system complies with the provisions in the PSM/RMP standard and that the systems procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  PS"

There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  The Behavior Based Safety (BBS) program to improve overall safety performance is entitled H.A.W.K. (Halting Accidents With Knowledge). The H.A.W.K. concept is based on changing worker behavior by individually conducting observations and providing feedback to both employees and contractors as they perform their duties.\n\nMajor efforts to improve safety are also underway with Rayonier's Job Safety Analysis (JSA) program.  The program consists of systematically analyzing jobs from a safety perspective.  This is accomplished by identifying all the jobs performed and breaking each job down into the steps taken to complete each task.  The potential accidents and hazards of each task are identified and recommendations are then provided on how to prevent these hazards from occurring.  Employees participate in this program by providing input on each analysis.  The resulting JSAs are used in training each employee on how to do the job safely.\n\nIncident investigations are also performed to improve safety.  These investigations are conducted whenever an incident has the potential to affect the safety of workers.  There is also a program to solicit safety suggestions from workers.  As a result of these activities, improvements can be achieved.  \n\nThe following process safety improvements are planned or have recently been completed.\n\nDue to production changes, there is less demand for chlorine use at the mill, and therefore, the amount of chlorine railcars on-site has been reduced. Improvements in the Cl2 unloading area have eliminated two of the four unloading stations and their associated pip"
