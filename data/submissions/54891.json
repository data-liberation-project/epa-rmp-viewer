To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, Rayonier uses four chemicals subject the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Fernandina Mill is classified as NAICS Code 32211 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\n2. Chlorine\n3. Chlorine dioxide\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process. \nThe current quantity of chlorine dioxide reported in this update for the chlorine dioxide covered process is significantly lower than the reported quantity in the previous RMP submissions. This change is the result of the exclusion of the chlorine dioxide inventory in the unit?s main storage tank.  The concentration of chlorine dioxide in the main storage tank is 0.8% or 8 ppm chlorine dioxide. This concentration is below the 1.0% minimum level specified in the RMP regulation. The 1009 pounds of chlorine dioxide reported in this update represents the calculated quantity of chlorine dioxide in the mill?s ClO2 generators. The generator system produces ClO2 at concentrations above 1% and the contents are subject to the RMP regulation.\n\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nReporting requirement removed. \n\n\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill is subject to both EPA and OSHA process safety management regulations.

The following 12 sections provide a brief description of the Mill?s management systems to address the program 3 accident prevention provisions of the EPA?s RMP regulation.\n\n1.4.1   Process Safety Information\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill has compiled written Process Safety Information (PSI) before conducting any process hazard analysis as required by the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The PSM standard requirements for PSI are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.65.  This compilation of written process safety information enables Rayonier and the employees involved in operating the processes to identify and understand the possible hazards posed by those processes involving toxic substances.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the toxic substances used in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.\n\nPSI has been collected and updated for Rayonier's four RMP process systems: ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Material Data Safety Sheets (MSDS), block flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams (P & IDs), and equipment information are stored in the PSM Information books, drawings, and equipment files.\n\n1.4.2    Process Hazard Review\n\nRayonier?s Fernandina Performance Fibers Mill has performed an initial Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) on all four covered processes as well as periodic analyses as required by the PSM/RMP regulations.  The PSM standard requirements for PHAs are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.67.  Initial PHAs were completed by May 1997 for Rayonier?s f"

PHAs identify, evaluate and control hazards involved the process.  Rayonier also has a system in place to address findings and recommendations that result from these studies \n\n\n1.4.3    Operating Procedures\n\nRayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill has developed, implemented, and maintains clearly written detailed procedures for safely operating and maintaining a process during all operating modes.  In addition to operating procedures, safe work practices have been developed and implemented for the control of hazards and include hot work, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, lockout/tagout, and control over the entrance into a stationary source.  These safe work procedures are in place and are reviewed and revised as needed, but at least on an annual basis.\n\n\n1.4.4    Training\n\nEach employee at Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill involved in operating a covered process has been trained to operate it safely and understands the training.  They also have been trained in the safety and health hazards of each process as required by 40 CFR 68.71 and evaluated for understanding of the training by a written test and/or on the job observations.\n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or more often if necessary.

Under the RMP rule 40 CFR 68.73, Rayonier has adopted this mechanical integrity system.  The system ensures that the process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases.  It includes written procedures, training, inspection, and testing, correcting system deficiencies and quality assurance.  These tasks are discussed further in the PSM Mechanical Integrity manual.\n\n\n1.4.6    Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is in place at Rayonier to prevent changes in the process and supporting equipment from introducing unacceptable hazards to workers.  This MOC system has written procedures for managing changes to be made to a PSM/RMP covered process.  The procedures require review prior to the change with a special emphasis on safety and training of employees and contractors.  Process Safety Information (PSI) and procedures are updated when a change is made. \n\n\n1.4.7    Pre-Startup Review\n\nPrior to starting up any new covered process or modified covered process, Rayonier performs a pre-startup safety review when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  This review ensures all requirements are met before the introduction of any highly hazardous chemical into a new or modified process.  This review is done before startup to verify that safety issues have been addressed. This final pre-startup review aids in ensuring that changes in the system are properly installed and tested before startup.  \n\n\n1.4.8    Compliance Audits\n\nAt least every three years, Rayonier evaluates the effectiveness of the PSM/RMP system.

Each permit is kept on file at least until completion of the hot work operations and inspections.\n\n\n1.4.12    Contractors\n\nRayonier selects contractors who perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process by obtaining and evaluating their safety performance and programs.  Each contractor is informed of any known hazards related to the contractor's work and the process and any applicable emergency response procedures.  Rayonier has implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence, and exit of each contractor in covered process areas.  \nRayonier periodically evaluates the performance of each contractor in fulfilling their obligations.  Contractors are obligated to:\n1.  Assure that each contract employee is trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job;\n2.  Assure that each contract employee is instructed in the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to his/her job and the process, and all applicable emergency response procedures;\n3.  Document that each contract employee has received and understood the required training;\n4.  Assure that each contract employee follows safety rules and safe work practices;\n5.  Advise Rayonier of any unique hazards presented by the contractor's work or of any hazards found.\n\nThe mill implements an extensive written contractor PSM program that includes an orientation conducted by mill employees. Successful completion of the contractor orientation process results in contractor employees being issued a badge necessary to access the PSM covered processes. \n\n\n1.5   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nRayonier keeps thorough records for all significant accidental chemical releases which occur at the Fernandina facility.

No significant releases have occurred for any of the mill?s four covered RMP chemicals (chlorine, chlorine dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia) over the last five years.\n\n\n1.6   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRayonier has a written emergency response plan for the Fernandina facility to aid in safely responding to accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  This emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n1.  Training responsible employees on procedures for being the \"First Responder\" in the event of a release.\n2.  Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances.\n3.  Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment.\n4.  Informing the local Nassau County Emergency Management team, which is responsible for responding to accidental releases, which could reasonably result in off site consequences. \n5.  Procedures for informing the public when necessary. \n6.  Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment.\n7.  Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan.\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All mill personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  Rayonier periodically conducts emergency response drills.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [i.e. OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and 29 CFR 1910.120(a)] and has been communicated to the local emergency "

Rayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill also maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief and routinely provides required information.\n\n\n1.7   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of the workers and the community.  There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  The \"Behavior Based Safety\" (BBS) program to improve overall safety performance is entitled \"H.A.W.K.\" (Halting Accidents With Knowledge). The H.A.W.K. concept is based on changing worker behavior by individually conducting observations and providing feedback to both employees and contractors as they perform their duties.\n\nMajor efforts to improve safety are also underway with Rayonier's \"Job Safety Analysis\" (JSA) program.  The program consists of systematically analyzing jobs from a safety perspective.  This is accomplished by identifying all the jobs performed and breaking each job down into the steps taken to complete each task.  The potential accidents and hazards of each task are identified and recommendations are then provided on how to prevent these hazards from occurring.  Employees participate in this program by providing input on each analysis.  The resulting JSAs are used in training each employee on how to do the job safely.\n\nIncident investigations are also performed to improve safety.  These investigations are conducted whenever an incident has the potential to affect the safety of workers.  There is also a program to solicit safety suggestions from workers.  As a result of these activities, improvements can be achieved.  \n\nThe following process safety improvements are planned or have recently been completed.\n\nDue to production changes, there is less demand for chlorine use at the mill, and therefore, the amount of chlorine railcars on-site has been reduced. Improvements in the Cl2 unloading area have eliminated two of the four unloading stations and their associated pip"

Emergency cut-off valves are located between the 1-inch hose and the railcar, and an additional emergency cut-off valve has been added in the common line after the hoses to reduce the potential quantity of chlorine released in the event of failure at this station.\n\nThe SO2 unloading hoses have been changed from 2 inch to 1 inch, and the emergency cut-off valve has been relocated between the hose and the railcar to reduce the potential quantity of SO2 released in the event of failure at this station. Two additional emergency cut-off actuation stations have been located on the railcar unloading platform. Future improvements are being planned to add emergency cut-off valves downstream of the hoses.\n\nThe Ammonia unloading system is being evaluated for potential installation of similar improvements aimed at reducing the potential quantity of ammonia released in the event of failure at this station.\n\n\n2.0    CERTIFICATION\n\nCertification was supplied with submission.\n\n3.0    REGISTRATION\n\nCertification was supplied with submission."
