      "SummaryText": "1.   The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of UAP/Richter are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated and is prepared to work with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee, or other authoritites, so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 114240 pounds in the facility's 2 tanks. The capacities of each of these tanks are, 57120 pounds.\n\n3.   The Worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the rail tank car releases as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 57120 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .82 miles.\n\n      The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1.25 inch transfer hose, with 5012 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .38 miles.\n\n4.   The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia, equipment, contaniers and storage facilities. These regulations administered by the Indiana State Chemist Office are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.   The Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the p"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning. Empl;oyees reeive pre-emergency planning and training in the event of an emergency.\n\n7.   Planned Changes To Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
