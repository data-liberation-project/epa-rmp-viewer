      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR ARG\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt American Refining Group, Inc. (ARG), we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* Facility specific information and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulations\n* Results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* An overview of or accidental release prevention programs\n* A five year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP regulations\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* Certification statement required by EPA\n* Detailed information (data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nARG produces petroleum base oils, naphthas, distillates, resins, extracts, gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oils, and blended lubricant products. The oil refinery consists of a Crude Oil Tank Farm, Crude Distillation Unit, Unifiner/Platformer Unit, Isomerization Unit, ROSE (Deresining) Unit, MEK (Dewaxing) Unit, Extract Unit, Boiler House, and Bulk Loading (fuels, naphthas).  Of these processes/areas, the ROSE and MEK Units have each been identified as containing more than 10,000 pounds of a RMP regulated substance (propane) and are thus covered under EPA's RMP regulations.  The remaining processes/areas either do not contain flammable or toxic materials above threshold quantities, or contain mixtures of listed regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity but are exempt based on Subpart F of the E"

      "SummaryText": "PA's RMP rule. The ROSE and MEK processes contain the following RMP regulated flammable chemicals with the potential for causing off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n* ROSE Unit - propane is unloaded from trucks to E-1 storage vessel (72,000 lbs). Propane is used as a solvent in the ROSE process to extract resins from the cylinder stock charge.\n\n* MEK Unit - propane is unloaded from trucks to D-23/D-18 storage vessel (50,400 lbs). Propane is used for chilling the products charged to the MEK Unit for de-waxing operations. \n\nNOTE: In 2008 a rigorous study (PSM maximum intended inventory determination) was conducted to determine the quantity of propane in the ROSE and MEK units. As a result, it was determined that the reported Quantity of propane in Section 1.17.c of the previous RMP submission, was based on the amount of propane in the respective unit storage vessels, rather than the total quantity in the process unit. This RMP submission (June 2009) accurately reports the proper quantity present in the entire process unit for each the ROSE and MEK Units. Because of this, the current Quantity reported in Section 1.17.c for each unit is significantly higher than in the previous RMP submission, however, there has been no actual increase in the amount of propane at each unit.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nWe use our off-site consequence analysis information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address potential scenarios.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key elements of successful provention programs"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP ruled during the past five years:\n\nWe have had no accidental releases under EPA's RMP rule in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an Emergency Response Plan, which incorporates state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our facility maintains volunteer emergency response teams for responding to emergency situations including a Fire Brigade, Hazardous Materials Response Team, Rope Rescue Team, and First Aid Medical Response Team.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. We are active participants in our Local Emergency Planning Commission (McKean County) and coordinate our plan with the community emergency response.  \n\nRECENT AND PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn May 2008, ARG completed a 3-year program with Indiana University of Pennsylvania's (IUP) PA OSHA consultation program to improve all health and safety programs, which included an independent audit of our PSM programs and a complete re-do of our Process Hazard Analyses for our R"

      "SummaryText": "MP and PSM covered processes. As a result, numerous PHA and audit recommendations were addressed to improve plant safety. Also, since the previous RMP submission, ARG has employed the services of outside consultants to assist in the continuous strengthening of our process safety management programs.\n\nARG had a pressure relief system study conducted in 2008 and has upgraded a number of pressure relief systems, as recommended by the study, during our April 2009 maintenance shutdown. ARG has also conducted a plantwide facility siting study in 2008 and plans to complete the mitigation phase of this program in 2009. In 2006 ARG began a plantwide instrumentation upgrade by converting its pneumatic controls to an Emerson Delta V distributed process control system. The final phase of this conversion is planned for late 2009. \n\nAmerican Refining Group is committed to quality environmental, health and safety programs. We strive to continuously improve our procedures and equipment.  We use audits, training, equipment inspections, recommendations from PHAs, and incident investigations to improve our environmental, health, and safety programs in order to better protect our employees and our community."
