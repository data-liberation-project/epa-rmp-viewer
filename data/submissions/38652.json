On April 30, 2004, the facility assets (except for the Ethylene Copolymers operations) were purchased by INVISTA S.a.r.l. (formerly known as Arteva Specialties S.a.r.l), a private company owned by a subsidiary of Koch Industries.\n\nA.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAs a DuPont facility, this site operated under DuPont Policies, Standards, and Guidelines which will remain in effect until they are replaced by the INVISTA SHE Policy, Management Systems, and Performance Standards appropriate to the hazards using the Management of Change Process.\n\nDuPont Policies, Standards, and Guidelines are available in hard copy at the facility.  These are implemented through the Victoria Plant Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) Manual.  The manual is available to employees through paper copies or the plantwide Intranet.  The 800 series of procedures in particular deals with the Process Safety and Risk Management requirements.  In addition, the Victoria Plant Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\nB.  SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe INVISTA Victoria Plant consists of 4500 acres, located approximately 9 miles south of the city of Victoria, Texas, in a rural setting south of SH 185.  About 1000 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 100 acres for bio-treatment and wetlands, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.\n\nThe site consists of manufacturing processes to produce Nylon Intermediates (hexamethylenediamine, adipic acid and dodecanedioic acid).  In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials or intermediates:\n- Anhydrous Ammonia\n- Aqueous Ammonia\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n- 1,3 Butadiene\n\nC.
