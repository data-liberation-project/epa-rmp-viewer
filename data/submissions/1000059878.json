PAALP\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Cordova Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by Plains.  At the facility, we receive propane via railroad tank cars.  The received natural gasoline is stored in pressurized storage vessels.  From these pressure vessels, propane can be loaded directly into tanker trucks for distribution to customers.\r\n\r\nPropane is an NFPA Class 4 flammable mixture.  There are no toxic substances present at the site. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by PAALP.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \r\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possib"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. Compliance with the PSM program under OSHA is almost identical to the compliance program for RMP. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the last five years there have been no chemical release accidents that resulted in onsite injuries, death, or property damage or offsite impacts. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the terminal with the Cordova Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Cordova Police Department, the Rock Island County Emergency Management Agency, and the Rock Island County Emergency Medical Services and, as appropriate, the Illinois State Highway Patrol.  The Cordova Facility Manager is responsible for interacting with these emergency response groups.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n\r\n\u00b7The Management of Change provisions"
