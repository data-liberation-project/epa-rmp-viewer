      "SummaryText": "1.The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of T. W. Ag Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so that can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored will be 95400 pounds in the facility's one (1) tank.  The capacity of this tank is 95400 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the one storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 81,090 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company rocedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch tansfer hose, with 11908 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 2 miles."
