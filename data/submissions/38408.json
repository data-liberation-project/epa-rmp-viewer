Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThis facility is predominantly an air separation plant producing gaseous nitrogen through the liquefaction and distillation of air.  Hydrogen is stored onsite in liquid form and vaporized for use by our customer in their manufacturing process.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled/stored by our facility, exceed the threshold quantity set by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to supply our customer with nitrogen and hydrogen gas.  The hydrogen is supplied from a liquid hydrogen storage system consisting of a 25,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tank and a bank of ambient air vaporizers.  The liquid hydrogen is delivered to our site by tank truck, and the gaseous hydrogen is delivered to our cu"

      "SummaryText": "stomer by pipeline. \n\nThe regulated process at this facility is the liquid hydrogen storage system and associated gaseous hydrogen piping. \nHydrogen is the only  regulated substance handled at this facility in an amount exceeding the threshold quantity.  The maximum amount of hydrogen at this facility is 15,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed  and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThe liquid hydrogen tank was installed in 1991.  In the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of, flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from the Pryor, OK facility and outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA?s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Tulsa Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
