The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is executed through its partner, Western Precooling Systems, Inc. (WPS). The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Cal West Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their Response Action.\n\nThe Company recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. Cal West Cooling policy includes development, maintenance and implementation of its Emergency Action Plan, and to train its employees in notification and evacuation procedures. WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency response capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  Emergency response equipment is maintained on-site and a relationship with the Oxnard Fire Department has been established.  Emergency response pre-planning has been coordinated through the Local Emergency Planning Committee, including the submission of appropriate EPCRA Inventory Reports. Each company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and t"

      "SummaryText": "raining.\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nCal West Cooling (CWC) is a facility located in Oxnard, CA in a commercial/industrial area of the city.  The facility was built in the early 1970?s on what were at that time the outskirts of the city.   Cal West Cooling is 100% owned by Western Precooling Systems. \n\n?Cal West Cooling manages pre-cooling and refrigerated storage.\n?Western Precooling Systems maintains the refrigeration system.\n\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables and fruit (strawberries).   The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July.  The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative.  Annual maintenance is performed on the equipment during August and September.\n\nThe refrigerant in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  Refrigeration equipment consists of HydroVac? Vacuum Tubes, Refrigeration Trailers (Compressor Units), Pressure Cooling System and Cold Storage Room Evaporators\n   \n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWestern Precooling Systems (WPS) is the company that operates and maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety "

As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.   Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Cal West Cooling and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established for the site, in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site RMP binder.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves were installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  WPS has installed these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\nModifications have been made to the piping system that gave more support to the piping in the event of seismic activity.  At the same time WPS decided to reduce its offsite consequence potential by piping all High Side relief valves to water absorbing tanks (dispersion/diffusion).  High Side relief valve excursions were identified as the most common unwanted release situation and b"

There have been demonstrations and tours of the system with the first responding engine companies to familiarize the crews with the facility layout and where hazardous areas are located.\n?The engine room is computer controlled with telephone access for monitoring and parameter changes.  The equipment may be shutdown from off site via phone if it were not possible to directly access the control area.\n?There is an automatic dialing machine that is connected to the computer control.  When there is an equipment failure, or when the pressures are rising and approaching the shutdown setting, or if there is a power failure, this auto dialer begins calling out to eight successive phone numbers to summon technicians to solve the problem.\n?Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.  There is no data to report.\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel that are not involved in the actual cooling process are trained to notify and evacuate.  Only personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standa"
