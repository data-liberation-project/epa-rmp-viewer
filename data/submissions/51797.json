Vessel is 250 psig MAWP rated container. Wellman Products Group administratively limits the actual quantity of ammonia in the tank to 7,820 gallons. Wellman Products Group uses the ammonia in a metal sintering process and/or nitriding process. The ammonia is used for the creation of a protective atmosphere within which the process can take place without loss of quality as well as for the nitrogen properties when nitriding of the metal is taking place.\n\nWellman Products Group is included in the Rogers County Local Emergency Planning Committee\u00bfs (LEPC) emergency response program. Wellman Products Group does have its own emergency action plans in place for internal response considerations. The LEPC\u00bfs emergency response program contains provisions for the use of a vast network of resources, communications and logistics, response management hierarchy and training and drills for possible third party responders. \n\nWellman Products Group internal emergency response procedures include the evaluation of any ammonia leak form the tank or associated piping. After evaluation of the leak and if necessary, personnel will be evacuated from the facility in a safe and organized manner, away from direction of the ammonia cloud. Any leak from the ammonia tank or associated piping that results in a likely possibility of the cloud leaving Wellman Products Group property, procedures are in place for the immediate notification of the local emergency services and the LEPC. Internally Wellman Products Group fully comply with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management, Hazard Communication and other safety standards. \n\nWellman Products Group understands that preventing a leak from the ammonia tank is far more desirable than having to mitigating a release from the tank or associated piping. To enhance Wellman Products Group prevention effort,"
