Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Giumarra Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Giumarra Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Giumarra Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities:\r\n \r\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical           | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nP3 - North System        Anhydrous Ammonia            28,000\r\nP4 - South System        Anhydrous Ammonia            54,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has two ammonia refrigeration systems that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\nProcess 3: North system\r\n(8) Storage rooms\r\n\r\nProcess 4: South system\r\n(11) Precool rooms\r\n(9) Storage rooms\r\n(1) Inspection room\r\n\r\nMost refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. Storage room 11 and 12 are equipped with water-cooling evaporators as required for flooded operation. Precool rooms 3, 6, and 7 are equipped with air-cooling evaporators as required for pumped overfeed (recirculated) system.\r\nThe control valve groups are located on the roof or alongside the cold storage buildings. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to or above each machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\r\n\r\nNorth Machinery Room\r\n(1) Reciprocating compressor\r\n(2) Screw compressors\r\n(2) Oil separators\r\n(1) High pressure receiver\r\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\r\n(1) Main suction accumulator\r\n\r\nNorth Condenser Area\r\n(2) Evaporative condensers\r\n(1) High pressure receiver (pilot)\r\n\r\nStorage 14\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(6) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nStorage 15\r\n(2) Accumulators\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nStorage 16\r\n(2) Accumulators\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nStorage 17\r\n(2) Accumulators\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mo"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to each high pressure receiver.\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere or the ammonia diffuser tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\n\r\nAn ammonia sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area and machinery room (north system only) that provides two-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm.\r\n\r\nAn emergency control box is installed below Condenser 4 (south system) and on the north exterior wall of the north machinery room (north system). Each box contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at Giumarra Vineyards Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are not interconnected by piping.  As such, each refrigeration system at Giumarra Vineyards Cold Storage is treated as a separate process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor a process and keep records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. \r\n\r\n1.3.3 Sulfur-Dioxide\r\nThe sulfur-dioxide process at the Giumarra Cold Storage facility is an integral part of overall business and lasts for approximately five months out of the year. It is extremely important that these areas and associated injection processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Giumarra Cold Storage is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of exposure to sulfur-dioxide.\r\n\r\nOur personnel also monitor the sulfur-dioxide fumigation process and keep an active log of all associated procedures and transactions. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the season by the outside contractor that supplies the SO2 cylinders. The contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our process equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nGiumarra Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nGiumarra Cold Storage's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- F"

Nevertheless, Giumarra Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Giumarra Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Giumarra Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nGiumarra Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Giumarra Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Giumarra Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document.
