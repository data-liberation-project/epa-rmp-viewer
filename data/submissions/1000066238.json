Wastewaters are received mainly by sewer system but some trucked in wastes are also accepted. As part of DELCORA's daily operations liquified chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide are used for disinfection and pH neutralization, respectively. The facility handles 24 one-ton containers of liquid chlorine and 15,000 gallons, fifty percent (50%), sodium hydroxide. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems, automatic shut-off systems and alarms.  Mitigation systems in use include complete enclosure of the chlorine supply and chlorination system, an automatic container shut-off device, and an emergency chlorine scrubber system.\n\n\n\nNo accidents have been reported over the past five years that meet EPA's reporting criteria (accidental release from covered processes in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage).  Existing procedures will be maintained for identifying and recording future accidents"

This Program has been coordinated with the SARA III Off-Site Response Plan, that has been included with the Program and will supersede the on-site response program in the event that an accidental release extends beyond the facility's boundaries.\n\n\n\nDELCORA is upgrading the chlorine gas process equipment and piping for improved safety and reliability. Recent changes have also been implemented to provide increased hazardous chemical inspections and improved safety container storage procedures."
