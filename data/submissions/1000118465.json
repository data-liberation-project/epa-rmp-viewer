Frontier Field Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kinetik, as operator of the MGP is dedicated to safety and environmental stewardship.  Safety and protection of the environment are integral Frontier's operations and corporate culture.\n\nKinetik policies are embodied in numerous Environmental, Health, & Safety policies and procedures.  At the MGP, these policies are outlined and implemented via the Kinetik Health & Safety Manual.  This manual is available to all employees, and all employees are trained in their specific responsibilities with regard to compliance.  In addition, the MGP complies with the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program requirements which are managed and implemented via the Kinetik PSM Manual.  This manual is also available to all employees, and employees receive specific training on Process Safety Management and their role in the program. \n\nTo help ensure safety of Frontier Field Service, LLC operations, the company invests significant resources in accident prevention.  Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes and operations facilities.\n\nSpecific engineering design and controls along with sound administrative controls provide the first and second tiers of accident prevention.  Experienced and well-trained employees that operate and maintain those facilities are the third tier.  If despite our best efforts to prevent such accidents a release should occur, an Emergency Action Plan created in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38 provides a plan"

      "SummaryText": "for safety of employees, contractors and the affected public.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe MGP, located in Lea County, New Mexico is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant which extracts hydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.  Three raw natural gas streams (Low Pressure System, Intermediate Pressure System and High-pressure System) are delivered via pipelines to the plant.  After extraction of the natural gas liquids, residue gas and the removed liquids are sold as product.  The site consists of inlet gas separation, dehydration, cryogenic gas processing, compression and product storage.  Products are transported from the plant via pipeline.\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR 68) the MGP's inventory of chemicals is evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances are on the plant in quantities above threshold levels established by code.  (Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance shall be regulated.)  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity:  ethane / propane / butane / condensate (EPBC) mix, condensate, and propane.  (Note: condensate is exempt from threshold determination based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 3.)  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\nBased on worst case analysis of the regulated substances, the distances to endpoints (i.e. An overpressure of 1 psi) include on offsite receptor, ConocoPhillips Production Office. In addition, Maljamar Gas Plant has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years.  Maljamar Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the dis"

      "SummaryText": "tance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following processes is greater than the distance to the nearest public receptor (ConocoPhillips Production Office):  propane and EPBC mix.  Within the past 5 years, the processes have had no accidental releases that caused off-site impacts as defined in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact named. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT SUMMARY\n\nNo reportable, accidental releases have occurred in the last five years. No deaths, injuries, significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage have resulted from any activities or incidents at the Maljamar Gas Plant for the last five years. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe MGP has around the clock communications capability with the Lovington Fire Department.  This provides a method for notifying the public in the event of an incident, if necessary as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic meetings with the Lovington Fire Department, the MGP personnel conduct emergency response drills."
