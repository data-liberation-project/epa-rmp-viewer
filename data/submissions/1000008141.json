Safety programs include training and work observation activities.  Material Safety Data Sheets and other chemical related safety information is made available to employees.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance:\nThis facility uses anhydrous ammonia to produce suspension fertilizers.  This is a minor portion of this facility's activity.  This facility is primarily a fertilizer and ag-chem retail facility.  The facility has one 18,000 gallon anhydrous tank with the maximum on-site volume of 50,000 pounds.  The tank receives inbound anhydrous ammonia via transport trucks (no rail).  The tank supplies one fertilizer suspension process with anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  \nRelease prevention acitivities involve daily inspections, routine equipment inspections, and an annual maintenance inspection of all equipment.   Operating procedures and maintenance procedures have been developed and training of employees is conducted.  \n\nFive-year Accident History:  \nThere have been no accidental releases within the past 5 years that resulted in off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  \nEmergency response acitivities include coordination with the Sale City Volunteer Fire Department and education of employees concerning the facility Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  \nEquipment, procedures, and training activities are being reviewed and will be updated to improve safety as determined by the ongoing review process."
