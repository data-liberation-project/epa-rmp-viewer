Facility Policy.\n        \n        The owners, management and employees of  United Suppliers, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Hughes County Commission, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\n        The pri,ary acctivity at this location is storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to Retail Agriculture Dealers and Farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and blended into 10-34-00 fertilizer.  This blending operation is preformed by a Mobil T-Reactor.  The T-Reactor process is a method of producing fertilizer composed of nitrogen and phosphorous.  The Nitrogen is supplied to the process in the form of anhydrous ammonia.  Phosphorous is supplied as wet-process superphosphoric acid.  Water is the other raw material and is used to dilute the plant nutrients to stable, standard grages of commercial fertilizer.  The standard grades produced by this processare 10-34-00 and 11-37-00.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia on hand during the blending operation would be 160,000 pounds.\n\n3.     Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n        a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railroad tank car.  The maximum quantity released would be approximately 160,000 pounds.  The distance to the end point is approximately 1.22 mile.  Operating Procedures are in place which include administrative controls and mitigation measures to reduce the possibility of a release.\n\n        b.
