We adhere to the DuPont Corporate philosophy that:\n\n\n\no All Safety incidents, Environmental incidents, and Occupational injuries and illnesses are preventable;   \n\no  All employees and contractors are responsible for their safety;  and\n\no  The \"Goal is Zero\" - Zero Incidents Period, \"ZIP\".\n\n\n\n     This means that we continuously strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents, and zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures, and management practices in place to support this goal of zero.  We constantly measure our progress towards this goal of zero and take corrective actions when deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n     The Corporate policies are embodied in the numerous Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  At the Parlin plant, the policies are implemented through the \"Safety How\" and site Process Safety Management Manual which is available and reviewed by all our employees.  In addition, the Parlin Plant's Emergency Manual details the complete emergency program for the site.\n\n\n\n     Our primary focus is on prevention of any accidental release.  However, we have strong emergency response capabilities to back up our prevention activities.  We use this combination of prevention programs and emergency response capability to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n      The DuPont Parlin plant, located in Sayreville, has been in operation since the early 1900's.  During this period, the plant has manufactured a variety of products including:  paints, thinners, pigments, adhesives, x-ray films, and graphic arts films.  We currently manufacture flexographic printing plates used in the printing industry, Teflon&reg; non-stick coatings f"

Acrylonitrile, a TCPA/EPA-regulated substance, is used as a raw material to manufacture one of the products described above.\n\n\n\n     The plant occupies approximately 350 acres of land of which 140 acres is set aside as a wildlife habitat area.  The plant is surrounded by a seven-foot high chain link fence including three angled strands of barbed wire on top.  All gates are kept locked except when under direct surveillance by plant guards or other plant personnel.  Ingress and egress for plant employees are via a card access system.  Visitors, contractors, and vehicular traffic follow an established procedure to enter and exit the plant.                                                                                                                                                                                  \n\n\n\n     The Facility is located within sight of suburban neighborhoods.  The storage of hazardous material and the placement of reactive processes are located in the inner portions of the plant site, each having at least 600 feet to the fence line and approximately 1,000 feet to the nearest homes.  The Sayreville Bordentown production well system is about two (2) miles south of the DuPont facility.\n\n\n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\n     The DuPont Parlin plant applies rigorous process safety management practices to all our processes and not just to those covered by laws and regulations.  These practices which are designed to prevent accidental releases include:\n\n\n\no  A thorough understanding of our process technology; including the safe limits of our processes and the proper design, construction, and installation of our equipment;\n\no  Systematic process hazard review studies to identify and manage process hazards;\n\no  Meeting or exceeding applicable codes and standards;\n\no  Written operating and maintenance procedures;\n\no  Extensive training for all our operators and maintenance perso"

The plant has an up-to-date written Emergency Response Plan and we routinely conduct drills to test the plan.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events and the Emergency Plan is updated to incorporate key learnings from the critique.\n\n\n\n     The plant has an emergency response team available 24 hours a day.  The team is thoroughly trained and properly equipped to respond to releases of any chemical stored or used on our plant.
