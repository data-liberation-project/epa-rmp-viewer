Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nTaylor Farms California operates a cold storage, produce processing and shipping facility in Salinas, CA. Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility. The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\nTaylor Farms California facility has both fixed and portable refrigeration systems onsite. The fixed system is composed of screw compressors, reciprocating compressor, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, plate frame heat exchanger, evaporative condensers, evaporative cooling coils, and a diffusion tank. Portable refrigeration systems are vacuum tube, refrigeration trailer, and falling film water chillers. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Safety relief valves protect all pressure vessels and compressors against high-pressure situations. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming. A list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration has been dedicated to respond and determine specific responses for any incident. Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2.    Description of Source and Substance Handled\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is used for vacuum cooling, produce cooling, and water chilling. The total charge for all the refrigeration systems is approximately 14,000 lb. The refrigeration system for the facility is a single-stage system providing cold (35A?F) storage temperatures. Refrigeration mechanical roo"

      "SummaryText": "m and condenser area outside the mechanical room houses compressors, ammonia pumps, pressure vessels the evaporative condensers and diffusion tank that serve as the high side for the fixed system room coils, plate frame heatexchanger and the portable water chillers. Portable vacuum tube is served by refrigeration trailer located next to the tube.  Vacuum tube and the falling film water chillers are moved to the Taylor Farms Food Service's  Yuma facility during the company's winter operation between November and April.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\nTaylor Farms California maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. Incident Investigation program is implemented to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point. Monitoring is 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and d"

      "SummaryText": "iffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves of the fixed system at the facility are tied into ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4.    Emergency Response Program\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if offsite evacuations are required. \n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\nThere has been one release at the Taylor Farms California facility resulted in ammonia gas liquid release of approximately 200 lbs. \n\n6.    Planned Safety Improvements\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA and safety inspection are listed in Hazard Mitigation Recommendations section of the RMP. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation\n"
