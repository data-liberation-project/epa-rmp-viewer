The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Triangle Ag, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 220,000 pounds in our 18,000 and 12,000 gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds. \n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 84,150 pounds.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the relase of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a 2 inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the storage tank to a nurse tank.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 12,000 pounds.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, Minnesota Department of Ag rules are followed.\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accid"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\nc.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for the implementation at this time.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "
