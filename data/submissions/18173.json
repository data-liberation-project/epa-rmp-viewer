Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n \n The Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant is committed to the protection of its employees, neighbors, and the community.  This objective will never be compromised and is the most basic obligation of all personnel at the plant.  We will meet or exceed all applicable laws and regulations, and strive for continual improvement in our Environment, Health, and Safety performance.\n \n We recognize our responsibility to provide a positive impact on the community.  This is accomplished by the prevention of hazardous exposures, injuries, fires, environmental releases, or damage to property.  We are firmly committed to the protection of the health and welfare of our employees and the surrounding community.  This objective will be accomplished by proper design, operation, and maintenance of the facility, and supported by rigorous training and safety reviews.\n \n Our emergency response plan is based upon a combination of government and company requirements.  Local response capabilities have been reviewed to ensure a coordinated response with all appropriate agencies.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying local fire and police departments, government agencies, as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\n \n2. The Charlotte Plant and Regulated Substances Handled\n7 The Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant manufactures latex emulsions.  These emulsions are used in a variety of products such as latex paint, adhesives, paper coatings and textiles. Two of the raw materials used to make these emulsions are acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate, which are both regulated under the EPA RMP Rule.  All products made at the plant are non-hazardous, and contains very low concentrations of the two chemicals, such that they no longer present a toxicity hazard.\n7 Acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate are transported to the Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant by rail"

The capacity of the acrylonitrile storage tank is 38,800 gallons, and the vinyl acetate storage tank is 60,000 gallons.  Unloading, storage, and manufacturing systems have all the necessary equipment for the safe unloading and use of these materials. \n7 Access to the Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant is restricted to authorized employees, and authorized contractors.  All persons seeking to enter the plant are required to undergo training in the plant safety rules before they are allowed entry.\n \n3. Worst-Case And Alternative Release Scenarios \n7 The worst case scenario is a catastrophic rupture (failure) of an acrylonitrile rail car filled to 28,000 gallons, the maximum amount that would be ordered. The case assumes that the entire contents of the rail car are released instantaneously to form a liquid pool, and that there are no safety or response systems in place.  The case does assume that the spill is contained within the spill containment area and dike around the storage tanks.  The distance to the toxic endpoint does result in off-site impacts.\n7 The alternate release scenario for acrylonitrile involves a leak of 700 pounds from a pipeline. The distance to the toxic endpoint results in off-site impacts, but does not affect any residential areas.\n7 The alternate release scenario for vinyl acetate involves the overpressurization and release of 960 pounds of  vinyl acetate from the rupture disk of a reactor.  For this to occur, several automated safety systems must fail, and the operators must violate several procedures.  The distance to the toxic endpoint results in off-site impacts, but does not affect any residential areas.\n \n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n The Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant complies with both the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the EPA RMP rule, as well as with all applicable State rules and regul"

The process is computer controlled, and equipped with redundant sensors, alarms and interlocks designed to ensure proper operation and prevent releases. We have written procedures covering all aspects of operation, including abnormal situations and how to correct them.  We review all equipment and process changes for safety, health, and environmental impact.  A preventive maintenance and inspection program is in place to ensure that equipment is operating properly. Plant staff undergoes an extensive training and certification program to ensure that all equipment is operated safely and efficiently.  We also fully investigate any incident to improve our procedures and process in the future.\n \n5. Five-Year Accident History\n During the past five years, we have had no accidental releases of either acrylonitrile or vinyl acetate with off-site effects. \n \n6. Emergency Response Program\n The Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the community plan. The plan includes procedures for public notification of emergencies that may affect the surrounding community.  Our responders have participated in training and drills with the local fire department and HazMat Squad to ensure that we are all well prepared to handle emergency situations.  In 1997, the plant hosted a community-wide response drill with the county, involving a worst-case scenario acrylonitrile spill. The site emergency response plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans.  The plan is intended to prevent hazardous material spills, protect the health and well-being of our employees and neighbors, protect the assets of Rohm and Haas and our neighbors, protect the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.\n \n7.

As a result of these studies, we have identified a number of ways we can improve our processes to make them safer.  Over the last several years, these changes have included a new computer control system with improved safety features, and an improved acrylonitrile storage tank designed to a more rigorous standard. We will continue to review our processes periodically to identify and implement further means of improvement."
