The Hattiesburg Water & Sewer Department Accidental release prevention policy involves operational procedures, management practices and continued training to prevent accidental releases.  Continued improvement of facilities and procedures will reduce accidental releases.  The emergency response policy involves procedures to notify and coordinate response with local responders.\nB.  Water Plant #1 is one of two water treatment plants that provide drinking water to the City of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the drinking water supply at this location.  This plant is located in the northern section of the city at 2800 Lakeview Road.  The maximum amount of chlorine at this facility would be eight one-ton containers.  This faciliy has at least one water treatment plant operator on site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  These operators can respond to any trouble that may occur.\nC.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release scenario\" and \"alternative scenario\".  Both scenarios were calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp software.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a failure of a one-ton chlorine cylinder with a 10 minute release duration and a release rate of 110 pounds per minute.  The offsite consequences of this scenaio are as follows:\n1.  Topography: Urban surroundings (many obstacles in the immediate area).  2. Toxic Endpoint: 0.0087 mg/l; basis: ERPG -2  3. Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.9 miles (1.4 kilometers)  4. Residential Populaton Estimate: 2075  \nThe meterorological assumptions about this scenario are:  Wind speed: 1.5 meters/second, Stability class F, Air Temp. 77 F.\nThe alternative release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in a release duration of 60 minutes.  The maximum average sustained release rate for this scenario would be 11"

Air Temperature 77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\n\nD.  The accidental release prevention program is based on the following elements:  1. Training of operators.  2. Preventive maintenance program.  3. Use of process and safety equipment.  4. Use of effective operational procedures.  5. Reviews of operational procedures, training, hazards and safety information.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self contained breathing apparatus and awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine.\n\nE.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past 7 years.\n\nF.  Our facilities are included in a community emergency response plan.  Our employees will not respond to an accidental release other than notify to the Hattiesburg Fire Department.  Emergency response will be handled by the Hattiesburg Fire Department's Hazard incident Response Team.\n\nG.  Internal training as well as training by outside sources is planned on a regular basis."
