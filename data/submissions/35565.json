The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 25 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe Maintenance Manager determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted. The Maintenance Manager then takes appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nBob Evans Farms is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Bob Evans Farms to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system."

The facility incorporates a standard evaporation and compression ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia vapor, High Stage Suction (HSS), from the +15? Recirculator Package (RFR02) equipped with 2 refrigerant pumps (RP1 and RP2) routed from (RFR02) to the suction inlet of 2 High Stage Screw Compressors (CMP6500 and CMP6501). Also connected, a Swing Compressor (CMP6512). Ammonia vapor, Low Stage Suction (LSS), from the -10? Accumulator (RFR05) to the suction inlet of 2 Low Stage Screw Compressors (CMP6507 and CMP6508).\n\nAll compressors are equipped with Thermosyphon oil coolers. Thermosyphon Supply (TSS) and Thermosyphon Return (TSR) are routed to and from the Thermosyphon Vessel (RFR03). This provides cooling for all (HSS and LSS Compressors). \n\nAt the High and Low Stage Compressors (HSS) vapor is compressed to a super heated vapor High Stage Discharge (HSD). (HSD) from the High Stage Compressors is routed to three Evaporative Condensers (CND6408, CND6410, and CND6514).\n \nAt the Evaporative Condensers the (HSD) rejects heat and converts to high-pressure Condensed Liquid Drain (CLD).  The Evaporative Condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across  ammonia coils. The (CLD) from the three Evaporative Condensers drains to the  Receiver (RCV6150). The Receiver (RCV6150) and Thermosyphon Vessel (RFR03) has a Equalizer (EQL). The vapor from the receiver and thermosyphon vessel is returned to the top of the (HSD) main at the Evaporative Condensers to Equalize (EQL) the pressure between the Evaporative Condensers and the Receiver and Thermosyphon Vessel. EQL is re-condensed into a CLD and returned to the  Receiver (RCV6150) and Thermosyphon Vessel (RFR03).  \n\nThe Recir"

Suction Accumulator (RFR01) to the suction inlet of 2 Low Stage Screw Compressors (CMP6507 and CMP6508). Also connected, a Swing Compressor (CMP6512). The -40? Suction Accumulator gravity drains through a check valve to the Transfer Vessel (RFR06). The Transfer Vessel periodically fills up and trips a transfer float switch.

The Evaporative Condensers have a purge point on each of the CLD outlets.  Each purge point consists of a solenoid valve with shutoff valves on either side for isolation.  Any non-condensables in the (PUR) are removed periodically by the Auto Purger.  The Auto Purger separates ammonia from the non-condensables by condensing the ammonia in the PUR to a liquid.  Any non-condensables are piped to a water bubbler to remove any traces of ammonia.  Condensed ammonia vapor is piped back to (LSS) main and on to the -40? Suction Accumulator (RFR01).\n\nHigh Temp.
