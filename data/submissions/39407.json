Additionally, the facility has had no ammonia related accidents in its operational history beginning December 1990.\n\nThe facility modeled two off-site consequence analyses.  The first was the worst case scenario that consisted of a full release of the ammonia storage tank, which is 12000 gallons or 61680 lbs. over 10 minutes.  This scenario had a toxic endpoint radius of 8.1 miles.  The second was an alternative release scenario that consisted of a hole in an unloading hose or pipe that was 0.4275 inches in diameter.  The release was 804.9 gallons or 4137 lbs. over 10 minutes that had a toxic endpoint of 0.41 miles.  \n\nThe facility has completed a Risk Management Plan and is actively implementing the RMP. The facility is in full compliance with all provisions of its RMP."

      "SummaryText": "OLS Energy-Agnews\nRMP for Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nOLS Energy-Agnews, Inc. of San Jose generates electric power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine. As part of its emissions control it injects diluted ammonia vapor into the turbine exhaust, and thus reduces NOx emissions.  The ammonia is stored in anhydrous form in a 12,000gal. storage tank, which is well anchored to prevent earthquake damage.  The ammonia is piped from there in liquid form to a vaporizer where it is turned into gas.  From there it goes to an accumulator.  From the accumulator it is mixed with air and injected into the turbine exhaust stream in the heat recovery steam generator.\n\n The facility has good preventative maintenance procedures and emergency response planning.  As part of the emergency response planning the facility has an Emergency Action Plan, which addresses every type of emergency or release the facility could expect.  The release of ammonia is specifically covered in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP for ammonia contains all emergency contact numbers as well as operator safety and mitigation procedures.   As part of the facility\u00bfs accidental release prevention, training is conducted annually for employees on Hazardous Material Handling, Hazard Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operation, maintenance, and emergency procedures.  There is a specific procedure for delivery and handling of anhydrous ammonia, which includes specific operational guidelines as well as emergency actions.\n\nThe facility has carried out a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  As a result or the PHA some safety improvements were made to the ammonia system and procedures.  These improvements are as follows:  1) Installation of relief valves between isolation valves on the piping between the unloading rack and the tank, 2) Conducted a seismic evaluation \u00bf installed flexible lines from the tank to the supply pipe, fill pipe, and the vapor return pipe, 3) Plan to install a"
