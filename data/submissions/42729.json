This is demonstrated by our\naccidental release prevention practices that cover areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the storage and distribution processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release were to occur, trained\nemergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. This includes the local Fire\nDepartment.\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nOur facility's primary activities encompass warehousing and wholesaling of chemicals. We have one substance present at\nour facility that is regulated under the EPA Risk Management Regulation. This substance, toluene diisocyanate, is used\nas a reactant in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers. No manufacturing of any type or\nprocessing of toluene diisocyanate or any other chemical takes place at this facility. The toluene diisocyanate is stored in\n55 gallon drums and the maximum inventory at our facility is 300,000 lb.\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nAs a Program Level One facility, we are not required to have a written prevention program according to the EPA definition;\nhowever, we have taken many steps to help ensure accidental release prevention. All materials are stored in containers\nconstructed according to Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements. The closed containers are stored in\naccordance with the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) codes. Containers are inspected for integrity when pulling\norders for shipment and during the loading process. In addition, the following elements of a release prevention program\nare in practic"

Five-year Accident History\nDue to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during the last 5 years.\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nOur facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The\nplan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations,\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected\nareas.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the\nplan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our facility that would require a modified\nemergency response.\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThere are no new developments and no findings that have resulted from the practice of the various accidental release\nprevention elements. No recommendations have been made."
