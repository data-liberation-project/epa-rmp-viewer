The process units operated by Enterprise involve the processing of liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) into their individual components such as ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The primary separation process utilized is fractionation by distillation.  Supplemental fired heat recovery units provide heat energy to the processes via a heat medium system.  A gas turbine is utilized to drive a refrigeration compressor while recovering the heated exhaust gases in one of the fired heat recovery units.  The facility utilizes an air assisted flare for any and all venting of the processes.  The plant has an ethanolamine based treating unit for the removal of Carbon Dioxide from the natural gas liquids.  Solid desiccant dehydration units are also part of the process to remove water from the natural gas liquid streams.  \r\n\r\nThe fractionated hydrocarbon products listed above are flammable substances regulated under the RMP regulation.  As noted earlier, the Port Allen Plant has two different processes on site.  Both the Fractionation Process and the Propylene Concentration Process are registered as RMP Program 3 processes.  The purpose of the RMP is to provide information about our operations, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case of an accidental release, our five-year accident history and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe operations at the Port Allen Plant were reviewed to determine the toxic and flammable hazardous materials that are present on site that are covered by the EPA Risk Management Program.

Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (SDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Port Allen Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal oper"

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Port Allen Plant uses Enterprise software-based change approval system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being imple"

Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Port Allen Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Port Allen Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Port Allen Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Port Allen Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce th"

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n \r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n* Plant video surveillance system\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\r\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\r\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Hand-held and wheeled cart fire extinguishers \r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., flame retardant coveralls, chemical protective clothing,  etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOver the past five years there have been no large or small releases which resulted in any injuries, property damage or offsite consequences.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Procedures Information\r\n\r\nThe Port Allen Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Port Allen Plant is coordinated with the West Baton Rouge Parish Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and"
