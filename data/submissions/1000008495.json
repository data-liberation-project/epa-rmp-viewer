Barber Foods is committed to operating its Portland, Maine facility in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community. Barber has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases. Barber has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant to respond to potential releases.\n\nB.  Barber operates a chicken processing and packaging plant located on St. John Street in Portland, Maine. Barber manufactures frozen chicken products filled with a variety of vegetable and cheese stuffings, chicken appetizers, patties, fingers and nuggets. All chicken products are frozen on-site prior to shipping to customers located throughout the world. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at Barber to freeze prepared foods and maintain a constant production area temperature of 50A?F (in accordance with USDA regulations).  The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed-loop system that extends throughout the facility.  There are five main anhydrous ammonia storage vessels at Barber including a high pressure receiver, two intercoolers, and two pump recirculators.\n\nC. The facility is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation and Compliance Audits.\n\nD. There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE. The facility has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the Portland Fire Department and the Cumberland County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC)"
