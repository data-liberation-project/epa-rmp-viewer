Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Orangeburg Facility located Highway 33 & Grambling Road, Orangeburg, SC  29115. The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Orangeburg Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Orangeburg Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely)will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nFACILITY\n\nHelena Chemical Company engages in the formulation, distribution, and sale of chemicals to customers, most of whom use Helena?s products to support agricultural operations. The Orangeburg Facility is retail agricultural chemical company that operates anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. .Anhydrous ammonia processes at this location include storage, loading, and unloading. Loading operations occur from rail cars and trucks to end use processes. End use processes may include fertilizer formulation and operation.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst case scenario release for the Orangeburg Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released. The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe "

      "SummaryText": "alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation. Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (rail guards, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since check valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Orangeburg Facility complies with U.S. EPA?s accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The Orangeburg Facility RMP provides safety information relevant to the on-site ammonia processes including MSDS documentation, storage and process limits, equipment specifications, and relevant codes and standards. The Orangeburg Facility has conducted a hazard review to ensure that potential safety problems are identified and addressed. The Orangeburg Facility has developed standard and consistent operating procedures that all employees follow when working with ammonia. The Orangeburg Facility ensures that all of its employees working with or around ammonia participate in a training program. The training program teaches employees how to avoid and respond to accidents. Helena Chemical Company has also established integrated operation and maintenance procedures, inspection requirements and schedules, compliance audits, and incident investigation procedures.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena Chemical Company?s Orangeburg Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no"

The RMP will be updated as the Orangeburg Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Orangeburg Office of Emergency Services.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4,5, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA?s RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Orangeburg Facility."
