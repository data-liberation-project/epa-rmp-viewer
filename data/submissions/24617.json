High-level switches are configured to high and low pressure receivers. High-level switches will shut down compressor operation during a high level condition.\n\n3. All compressors are configured with critical safety controls (high pressure, low pressure, high oil temp cut-outs, etc.) to shut down the respective compressor in the event of an abnormal operating condition.\n \n4. Safety Relief Valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and compressor oil separators to eliminate over pressurization conditions in those associated pieces of equipment.\n\n5.

The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\n\nThe Jac-Pac Foods, Ltd. facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain process rooms and warehouse cooler and freezers temperatures for various types of fresh and frozen food distributed to their customers. The refrigeration system contains the following equipment: 2 compressors, 2 evaporative condensers, 1 high pressure receiver, 1 low pressure receiver, 32 evaporators, 1 purger. The refrigeration system contains and estimated 11,000 pounds of aggregate ammonia. \n\nThere are approximately 600 employees at this facility that include hourly and salary personnel.  This food processing operation facility receives and processes shipment of meats via tractor trailers.  Site operations run Monday through Saturday on a first and second shift.  Monday through Saturday a third shift sanitation (clean-up occurs.  Sundays are primarily for maintenance and facilities work.  Distribution operates Monday through Saturday 20 hours per day.  Cooking operations occur 24 hours a day; 7 days a week. \n\nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n \nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks.

General accidental release and prevention policy of Jac-Pac Foods, Ltd.:\n\nIn this meat processing operation, we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency USEPA. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and the environment.  \n\nIt is our policy at Jac-Pac Foods, Ltd. to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by.  The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia.  Our plant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\nAs a Program Level 3 RMP facility, this site has an extensive process safety management (PSM) program and is committed to the implementation of this program and the prevention of toxic release from the Jac-Pac facility.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nJac-Pac Foods, Ltd., located at 163 Hancock Street, Manchester, NH operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.
