      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\r\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n2.\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored at the site. The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity to 85% of the fill capacity for both covered processes. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 154,275 pounds.\r\nAqua ammonia (20% of ammonia by weight) is stored in eight above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 405,450 gallons of solution. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 20% active ingredient by weight, is 741,973 pounds. \r\n \r\n3.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 and Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. Prevention elements for each program are listed below.\r\n\r\nAqueous Ammonia Storage Prevention Program 2 Elements\r\n2755.1\tSafety Information\r\n2755.2\tHazard Review\r\n2755.3\tOperating Procedures\r\n2755.4\tTraining\r\n2755.5\tMaintenance\r\n2755.6\tCompliance Audits\r\n2755.7\tIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Storage Prevention"
