This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n2.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored at the site. The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity to 85% of the fill capacity for both covered processes. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 154,275 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (20% of ammonia by weight) is stored in eight above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 405,450 gallons of solution. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 20% active ingredient by weight, is 741,973 pounds. \n\n \n\n3.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 and Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \n\n \n\n5.    EXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, ?2745.7(q); the following external events analysis information shall be submitted:  \n\n?    The types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2 or Hazard Review Section 2755.2.  \n\no    During the April 2009 PHA and March 2012 PHA, a broad list of external events was considered by the Team.  General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia were addressed.  The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact.\n\n?    The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required. If seismic events are applicable, the parameters used in the consideration of the seismic analysis and which edition of the Uniform Building Code was used when the process was designed.\n\no    The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team.\n\n?    For each external event, with a potential to create a release of a regulated substance that will reach an endpoint offsite, apply \n\n1)    The expected date of completion of any changes resul"

The date of the most recent field verification that equipment is installed and maintained as designed.\n\no    The most recent field verification of equipment was conducted September 2012 and included the major equipment of the process. \n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.6 (l) and 2745.7 (q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia were addressed by the PHA or Hazard Review.\n\n6.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nEmployees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency the facility will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders. The facility has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders.\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 ?3220 is in place.\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  At this point, the BUCRA - Supply Division facility has not identified any safety-related improvements to be made."
