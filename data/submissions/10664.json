Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to\nprevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\nHowever, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will\nrespond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES.\n\n   Seadrift Coke, L.P. is located on Texas Highway 185\nSouth, one (1) mile south of the intersection of Texas State\nHighway 185 and Highway 35, North Seadrift, Texas 77983.\nOur facility consists of one delayed coker and a rotary\nkiln. The primary product is calcined petroleum needle coke\nproduced from decant oil feedstock. Byproducts from the\ncoking process are gas oil, naphtha, light coker naphtha and\nfuel gas. Naphtha, light coker naphtha and fuel gas are\nregulated flammable substances. The other regulated\nsubstance is chlorine, which is used for water treatment.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS.\n\n   The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic\nsubstance at our facility involves a catastrophic release of\nthe entire content of a full chlorine cylinder due to broken\nnipple or valve.  This scenario assumes release duration of\n10 minutes, a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and ambient\nair temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit. While the maximum\nquantity of chlorine stored per site is limited to 2000\npounds, which is less than the RMP threshold quantity for\nchlorine, we have developed numerous controls to prevent\nsuch releases and managed their consequence. No credit for\nadministrative controls was into account in evaluating this\nscenario. The maximum distance to the endpoint of 3ppm\n(0.0087 milligrams per liter) for the WCS is 3.0 miles.\n   The alternative release scenario (ARS) involves the\nfailure of a therm"
