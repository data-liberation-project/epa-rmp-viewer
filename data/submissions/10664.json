      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n   Seadrift Coke, L.P. is committed to worker and public\nsafety as demonstrated by the resources invested in accident\nprevention, such as training personnel and considering\nsafety in the design, operation, and maintenance of our\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to\nprevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\nHowever, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will\nrespond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES.\n\n   Seadrift Coke, L.P. is located on Texas Highway 185\nSouth, one (1) mile south of the intersection of Texas State\nHighway 185 and Highway 35, North Seadrift, Texas 77983.\nOur facility consists of one delayed coker and a rotary\nkiln. The primary product is calcined petroleum needle coke\nproduced from decant oil feedstock. Byproducts from the\ncoking process are gas oil, naphtha, light coker naphtha and\nfuel gas. Naphtha, light coker naphtha and fuel gas are\nregulated flammable substances. The other regulated\nsubstance is chlorine, which is used for water treatment.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS.\n\n   The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic\nsubstance at our facility involves a catastrophic release of\nthe entire content of a full chlorine cylinder due to broken\nnipple or valve.  This scenario assumes release duration of\n10 minutes, a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and ambient\nair temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit. While the maximum\nquantity of chlorine stored per site is limited to 2000\npounds, which is less than the RMP threshold quantity for\nchlorine, we have developed numerous controls to prevent\nsuch releases and managed their consequence. No credit for\nadministrative controls was into account in evaluating this\nscenario. The maximum distance to the endpoint of 3ppm\n(0.0087 milligrams per liter) for the WCS is 3.0 miles.\n   The alternative release scenario (ARS) involves the\nfailure of a therm"

The 3-minute period is the\napproximate time to discharge all the chlorine in the\ncylinder. This scenario assumes a wind speed of 7 miles per\nhour. No other mitigation measures are taken into\nconsideration in evaluating this scenario. The maximum\ndistance the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm (0.0087 milligrams per\nliter for this ARS is 1.3 miles.\n   The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances\nin Program 3 processes at this facility is a vapor cloud\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a storage\ntank containing naphtha.  The full inventory of 3,500,000.00\nlb. is assumed released, completely vaporize, and ignite\nresulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi\nendpoint for this WCS is 1.2 miles. Although we have several\ncontrols to prevent such releases and to manage their\nconsequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was\ntaken into consideration in evaluating this WCS.\n   The ARS for flammable substances for this facility is a\nVCE involving caused by a leaking light coker naphtha\ntransfer line. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint is\n0.1 miles. Emergency planning and responses have been\ndeveloped for these cases. Figures 1 and 2 graphically\ndepict the hazard assessment for the toxic and flammable WCS\nevents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS.\n\n   The following is a summary of the general accidental\nprevention program in place at Seadrift Coke, LP. Since all\nthe processes subject to the EPA RMP regulation are subject\nto the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the\nOSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in\nplace to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n   It is the policy of Seadrift Coke, LP to encourage and\nprovide opportunities for all employees to participate in\nthe design, implementation of our Loss Control effort.\nOpportuni"

      "SummaryText": "stem for ensuring that\noperation and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\n     It is the policy of Seadrift Coke, LP that all\nemployees receive adequate training and demonstrated\nproficiency before being assigned to a task. Training is\neffected through the use of written task analyses and\nstandard operating procedures, audio/visual aids, hands-on\ntraining through pairing with senior operators for process-\nspecific duties and tasks. Proficiency is verified through\njob observations, oral and written examinations before\noperators can work independently.\n   Upgrade or refresher training is provided to ensure that\nemployees' knowledge and awareness of hazards, proper\nmethods and procedures remain at an acceptable level. All\naffected employees receive refresher on mandated training no\nlonger than every three years.\n   \nContractors\n\n   Seadrift Coke, LP is committed to a program of selection,\ntraining, and monitoring of temporary and contract employees\nthat will ensure the safe and efficient completion of their\nwork. Prior to the selection of contract firms for\nmaintenance, repairs, turnaround, major renovation, or\nspecialty jobs on covered processes, an evaluation of the\nfirm's safety program and performance is conducted. All\ncontractors are informed of known fire, explosion and toxic\nrelease\nhazards.\n   Seadrift Coke, LP personnel periodically evaluate\ncontractors and contract employees to ensure they are\ntrained in safe work practices, properly informed of all\nknown hazards and emergency procedures, and to ensure that\nSeadrift Coke, LP is advised of any unique hazards their\nwork may present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n   Seadrift Coke, LP conducts pre-startup safety review for\nall changes to equipment, materials, and operating\nparameters. PSSR is to ensure that safety feature;\nprocedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately\nprepared for startup prior to placing equipment into\nservice.
