(Agriform) Pleasant Grove Facility (Facility) located at 4036 Pleasant Grove Road, Pleasant  Grove, California 95668 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (ER/CP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.  Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 25,000-gallon, above-ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 365,750 pounds.    \n\n3.    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nAqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 182,875 pounds of aqua ammonia within a secondary containment structure.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters. \n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  Agriform ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and avail"

The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place in April 2010.\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the ammonia and pesticide processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on April 30, 2010.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised in April 2010.\n\nTraining:  The Agriform Facility staff, as well as The Tremont Group, Inc. (Tremont) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed in May 2008.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\nA?    Initial employee training;\nA?    Periodic refresher training;\nA?    Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\nA?    Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\nA?    Training records for each employee.\n\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical  integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted on April 9, 2010, and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted in December 2008.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conduc"

The most recent compliance audit was conducted in April 2010. \n\nIncident Investigation:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place.  The program includes investigation requirements and reporting and would be implemented in the event of an incident.\n\nIn addition to the prevention program elements described above, the following chemical-specific prevention steps have been implemented.\nAqua Ammonia:  The Facility implements the provisions of the A?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, A?Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety OrdersA?; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous AmmoniaA? as they apply to the storage and handling of aqua ammonia.\n\n5.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of aqua ammonia during the last five years resulting in death, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage.\n\n6.    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facilityA?s emergency response program is developed in accordance with Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code, Hazardous Materials Business Plan requirements.  An Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (ER/CP) has been prepared and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n7.
