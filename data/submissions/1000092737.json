The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 841 West Elkhorn Boulevard in Rio Linda, California (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 9,600 gallons each.  The anhydrous ammonia is used in a reaction process for the production of ammonium polyphosphate. The contents of the storage tanks are consumed in entirety during the reaction process. There is one 16,000-gallon aqueous ammonia tank located at the facility. Wilbur-Ellis is subject to OSHA PSM for anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia; therefore, Program 3 requirements are applicable to the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is also a retailer of pesticides. The facility sells pesticides in liq"

For the pesticides, Wilbur-Ellis is subject to Program Level 1 of CalARP requirements.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by CalARP and Federal Risk Management Program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of ammonia, dimethoate, methomyl, oxamyl, paraquat dichloride, and peroxyacetic acid that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia, dimethoate, methomyl, oxamyl, paraquat dichloride, and peroxyacetic acid in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Sacramento County Fire Department (\"fire department\") and Sacramento Environ"

In compliance with 2765.1, the facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1. Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2. Information on emergency health care.\n\n3. Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor. Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1. Update the start up and shut down procedure to include more descriptors\n\n2. Consider updates to the SOPs to be user friendly\n\n3. Update the Ammonia offloading procedure\n\n4. Consider implementing signs in the Reactor Area noting that only authorized personnel should be in the area.\n\n\n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs.
