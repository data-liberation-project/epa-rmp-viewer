Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Fletcher Grain Company, Malta Bend, MO. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of  propane.\n If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nPropane is stored and sole at retail for heating fuel.  It is stored in two tanks of 12,000 gallons capacity each.  The maximum amount stored is 75,500 pounds.\n\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the contents of the largest storage  tank as an explosion that would produce a pressure wave of 1.0 pounds per square inch (psi).  The distance that wave would travel would be 0.3 miles.\n\nb.    The alternate-case scenario would be the release of 69 pounds of the material as the result of a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the 1.0 psi endpoint of the pressure wave would be 0.03 miles. \n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 58/ 1992 edition.  That standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of  propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.
