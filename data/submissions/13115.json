FACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE POLICY\n     The owners, management, and employees of Ag Production Company, Turlock Facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 3106 S.Faith Home Rd., Turlock, Ca., 95380 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire dept. or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers,in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The pesticides are recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application in pest control.\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck or rail car and stored in 51 above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia on hand at any moment is 370,000 lbs.  \n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n     The worst case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 160,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volumne of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.73 miles.  The alternative release scenario based on a most likely potential incident is a release from a 2 inch pipe or hose diameter.  The distance to the end point is .060 miles.\n\n4."

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     There Have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or regulated pesticides in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n     The facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n     -  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38\n     -  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n     -  Section 25503, division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n     Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia at the facility"
