The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Rocklin Terminal.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Rocklin Terminal.\n\n\n\nWorse Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves the failure of one bank of propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  The entire inventories of all six tanks are simuilated due to the fact that all of the valves on the individual banks are normally open and tied into a single header.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the public would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting data elements of the Risk Management Plan\n\n \n\nAlternate Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this scenario is 0.2 miles.  This scenario assumed that a tuck loading pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 255 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 10,800 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  \n\n\n\nMitigation measures wer"

The Enterprise Rocklin Terminal has a Hazardous Material Business Plan that is accessible to the fire department in a box at the entrance of the facility.  Another copy of the Plan has been filed with the Placer County Environmental Health Department.  The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source of fuel from a safe location or activate one of the shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1, evacuate personnel and secure the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.
