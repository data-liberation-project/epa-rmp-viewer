      "SummaryText": "Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (40 CFR 68.115(b))\r\n\r\nHilti Inc. (Hilti), a construction equipment and chemicals supplier, leases a warehouse located at 3737 Rock Quarry Rd. STE 400, Dallas, TX (DFW Warehouse). The DFW Warehouse serves as a distribution center for various construction tools, fasteners, and chemicals, including insulation foams and sealants in the form of aerosol cans.  The aerosol foam cans are received at the warehouse inbound area in full pallet format, generally up to 16 cans per carton with a maximum of 64 cartons per pallet.  All flammable aerosols are stored together in a chain-link fenced cage within the cold (<80 F) storage area of the facility.  Customer pick orders list the number of individual cans, cartons, or pallets of material that are selected for relocation to the outbound area. These aerosols contain propellants that include flammable substances that are subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements as a flammable mixture. There is no bulk (drum, tote, tank) storage or chemical processing operations at the site. The regulated chemicals at the DFW Warehouse consist of aerosol propellants and include the following:\r\n\r\n-  Isobutane (CAS #75-28-5);\r\n-  Butane (CAS #106-97-8);\r\n-  Dimethylether (CAS #115-10-6); and\r\n-  Propane (CAS #74-98-6)\r\n\r\nThe Hilti DFW Warehouse is eligible for the RMP Program 1 because the facility has not had a reportable release in the previous five years, the distance to the flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public receptor, and emergency response procedures are coordinated between Hilti and the Dallas Fire Department. Under Program Level 1, Hilti is only required to include data for the worst-case release scenario, and therefore, only a worst-case scenario is included with this submittal.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (40 CFR 68.115(a))\r\n\r\nThe"
