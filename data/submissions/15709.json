Also, as the operator of a facility at which substances may be used that in uncontrolled situations could cause harm to the public and damage to the environment, we will strive for environmental excellence with a commitment to continual improvement, pollution prevention and compliance with legislative requirements.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) is one of these programs.\n     Each employee in areas where the RMP is applicable will be knowledgeable of the related policies and procedures and the supervisors or a designated person is required to insure that they understand them.  Employees and supervisors are required to comply with our policies and are subject to corrective action in those cases determined to indicate willful violation.\n    A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program has been developed as a part of our Release Prevention Program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119.  A compilation of safety information to enable Wabash Alloys and the employees involved in the chlorine operations to operate safety has been accumulated.  This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of the chemical listed.

      "SummaryText": "mpany.  While owned by U.S. Reduction Company a secondary aluminum smelter operation was constructed and is presently in use by Wabash Alloys.  The site was purchased by Wabash Alloys in 1998.\n    The site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a maseparation process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n    The sorted aluminum is charged into one of three furnances where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-site for the process are aluminum, magnesium, zinc, copper, silicon, sodium, beryllium, and strontium.  All of these materials are in solid form and are stored inside the facility, except for the aluminum, which is kept outside.  Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at any given time.\n    Once the molten product is prepared, the melt is either poured and cooled as ingots or sows, or is transferred to heated crucibles for shipment as a molten material.  Particulate emissions from the crusher are controlled with a baghouse.  The emissions from the dryer are treated first using a secondary combustion unit, and then with a baghouse.  Emissions from melters, ingot and sow molding processes, and dross cooling operations are controlled using a baghouse.\n    Chlorine is received at the facility in one ton containers.  There are eleven containers as the main supply and four containers as a storage pad.  The containers are connected into piping through which chlorine as a l"

Chlorine gas exits the vaporizer through a regulator and into a piping manifold.  Each furnace has its own chlorine supply pipe and flowmeter which regulates the pressure.\n     At each particular furnace the chlorine gas passes a shut off valve, then through another flowmeter, and then through a needle valve where its flow is regulated by the furnace operator to the molten metal pump.  Close to the needle valve is the tubing connection that connects to a carbon lance which feeds the gas to the pump housing.  Here the chlorine reacts with magnesium and aluminum to demag and clean the aluminum alloy.\n    Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n    As a part of the Wabash Alloys proactive program concerning the hazards of chlorine to its' workers and the surrounding public, its staff has conducted a thorough hazard assessment.\n    For the hazard assessment and the RMP, populations potentially affected are defined as those within a circle that has as its center the point of release and its radius the distance to the toxic or flammable endpoint.  Owners or operators may use Census data to define this population.  The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted.  The presence of environmental receptors within this circle must also be listed.  The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas, that can be exposed to an accidental release.\n    One worst case scenario for chlorine was decided upon as the complete rapid loss of a 55 tons from the tan"

The only likely causes for such an incident is felt to be from a natural disaster or a derailment of the tanker car.\n    The worst case scenario for chlorine was decided as the complete rapid loss of one ton of chlorine during a one minute time frame. The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class D , 5.5 mph wind speed, and the level of 3ppm for chlorine.  This resulted in a release rate of 2,000 lbs/min, and an end point of 4.23 miles from the spill point during summer season at 90 degrees F and 4.04 miles from the spill point during winter season at 30 degrees F.  \n    The alternate case scenario for chlorine was decided as the loss of chlorine resulting from a release through a 1 inch line break. . The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class D , 5.5 wind speed, and the level of 10ppm for chlorine.
