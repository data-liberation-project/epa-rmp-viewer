Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Our facility has a written emergency preparedness plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nAshland's Houston facility maintains active involvement with the local community.  This provides opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility receives and stores chemicals used primarily for industrial water treatment and the marine industry.  This facility handles only one RMP regulated chemical, cyclohexylamine.  Cyclohexylamine is received in UN Specification containers, diluted with water in a blend tank, and repackaged and sold to our customers.  The threshold quantity of cyclohexylamine is only exceeded in the flammable storage area.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashland.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.
