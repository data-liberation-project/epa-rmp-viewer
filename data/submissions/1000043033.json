The RB WWTP is located at 10001 Southside Road in the east portion of the City of El Paso, Texas, adjacent to the international boundary with Mexico. The RB WWTP is surrounded by urban, residential, and vacant land.\n\n\n\nCurrently the RB WWTP has the potential to store up to twenty-eight (28) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage room, allowing the potential to store a total of 48,000 pounds of chlorine. However, the normal storage is twelve (12) one-ton chlorine containers at any one time. The average amount of chlorine managed at RB WWTP is 24,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n\n\n?    Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 22,850 people; Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population in Mexico resides within the vulnerable zone.  The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint zone for both worst case and alternative scenarios.

The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), is the responsible agency to monitor the ecosystem of the Rio Grande. \n\n\n\n2.  The Rio Bosque Park.  Located south of the RB WWTP, the Rio Bosque Park is a 372-acre wetland. This natural habitat can be a highly productive ecosystem during the monsoon season.  The park is owned by the City of El Paso and provides habitat to wildlife and migratory birds. \n\n\n\nThese two environmental receptors qualify as vulnerable zones in the worst case release scenario. There were no vulnerable zones found in the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n?    Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release.
