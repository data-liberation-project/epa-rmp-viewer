Flooding is also included in this plan.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe site has not had any accidents to report as part of the RMP.   \n\nEmergency Response Program\nOur emergency response plan provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The facility maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fire, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills and medical emergencies. The facility trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan by actively participating with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\nThe facility is continuously looking to reduce the number and size/impact of process safety containment events; one area of focus is on Return-to-Operations and ensuring there are no open-ended lines. \nThe facility is also improving safety by implementing the Prevent. Protect. Respond. (PPR) campaign. PPR focuses on strengthening operational discipline, the identification and mitigation of hazards, and executing appropriate action in response to unplanned events.\n\nRevision History\n7/10/24 Five-Year Renewal\n-\tcombined the OXO, VAM and LGT/FARM Processes into a single process due to interconnectivity;\n-\tmodified Alt Case Scenarios to align with Process Hazard Analysis scenarios;\n-\tadded acetaldehyde and 1-butene."

Audits are conducted using an established schedule for the site.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n- Incident investigation \u0096 The facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a serious release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root causes leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  \n- Employee participation \u0096 The company operates on the premise that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues, to attend applicable reviews, and to recommend improvements.  Improvements are solicited and implemented as appropriate.

The procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n- Training \u0096 The facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors and the public, as well as protection of the environment. The company/corporate policies are embodied in the numerous EH&S and Engineering standards which apply globally. At UCC, these policies are implemented through the site and global EH&S programs.\n\nFacility Description\nThe Texas City facility produces Oxo alcohols and aldehydes, organic acids, acetic esters and vinyl acetate.  In the process, the regulated substances that meet the threshold are acetaldehyde, 1-butene, ethylene, propane, propylene and vinyl acetate monomer. \n\t\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical:\nThe worst-case scenario (largest impact) is for vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). \nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical:\nThe Alternative case for vinyl acetate monomer will impact a small area just west of the site. \nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemical:\nThe worst-case flammable is propane. \nAlternative-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemical:\nNone of the alternative-case scenarios will impact public receptors.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n- Process safety information - Our work processes have comprehensive information that are used to guide the choice of process and control technologies, operating parameters, and inspection intervals for equ"
