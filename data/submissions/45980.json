In support of this commitment it is the policy of facility management to support, promote and implement accident release prevention and emergency response.\n\nFacility Description (Stationary Source)\nName: Emerald Kalama Chemical, LLC\nAddress: 1296 Third Street NW,  Kalama, WA  98625-9799\nEPA ID#: WAD092899574\n\nThe facility is located on the north boundary of the city of Kalama, Washington, near Columbia River mile post 74.  The facility operates 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  The site consists of 155 acres, 39 of which are developed.\n\nAcetaldehyde is the only substance present on the plant site above the threshold quantity for RMP planning (10,000 pounds).  Acetaldehyde is used in the manufacture of flavoring and/or frangrance products.  The maximum quantity of acetaldehyde is limited by administrative procedures and storage capacity.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would result in an off-site impact.  Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures such as operating and emergency response programs are in place to limit the impact distance and severity.  Alternative Release Scenarios were considered via the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)  program.  The facility has an emergency response plan designed to respond to and mitigate the Alternative Release Scenarios identified in the PHA studies.  The plan has been reviewed and modified as necessary to coordinate with the community emergency response plans.\n\nThere have been no events involving acetaldehyde at the facility in the RMP reporting history."
