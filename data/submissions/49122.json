This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel  and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations,  industry standards and practices, facility process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on years of company and industry experience.   Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Mandan Refinery is located at 900 Old Red Trail in Mandan, ND.  The refinery is owned by Tesoro Petroleum Company.   The refinery processes 59,000 barrels of crude oil per day in a variety of processes to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),  etc.  The refinery has eleven (11) processes that contain materials above the threshold quantity and are, therefore, covered by the RMP rule. These processes are all classified as Program level 3 processes.  All covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.   The flammable mixtures typically contain  various regulated substances such as but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. In addition, one process contains hydrogen fluoride above the 1,000 pound threshold quantity and one process contains ammonia above the 10,000 pound threshold quantity.\n\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenarios (WCS):\nThe"

The WCS endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in a process filled to capacity resulting in a VCE.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effect of the WCS.  Based on the distances to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, effects from the WCS would reach offsite.   Tesoro has calculated the WCS as required by the rule, and has provided detailed information to the EPA and the Morton County and Burleigh County LEPC?s. \n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS):\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a release of flammable liquids (primarily butane) from a 2 inch piping leak.  Under this scenario, the release is isolated by operators within 20 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, would reach offsite.   This release scenario was selected based on industry history, and because it is a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  Details concerning the ARS analysis have been provided to the EPA, and the Morton County and Burleigh County LEPC?s. \n\nToxic WCS:\nOne of the toxic WCS for the refinery involves the chemical Hydrogen Fluoride.   Tesoro has calculated the WCS as required by the rule and has provided detailed information to the EPA and the Morton County and Burleigh County LEPC?s.  The distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint of 20 ppm (0.016 mg/l) would reach offsite. The distance was calculated using the HEGADAST model (EPA Guideline, Appendix 2).

During routine operation, the HF acid is contained in multiple smaller vessels where the potential quantity for release is substantially less. The deinventory drum, which is normally empty, is used for storage during maintenance shutdowns at a frequency of approximately 4 weeks every three years.  However, the quantity of HF stored during maintenance shutdowns is minimized by using administrative controls and would be significantly less.\n\nThe second WCS for toxics for the refinery involves the chemical ammonia (anhydrous).  Tesoro has calculated the WCS as required by the rule and has provided detailed information to the EPA, Morton County LEPC and Burleigh County LEPC.  The distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint of 150 ppm (0.14 mg/l) would reach off site. The distance was calculated using RMP Comp software provided by EPA.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems and safety systems are not included in deterining the distance to the endpoint.  The quantity of ammonia used for the WCS calculation is the maximum amount that would ever be contained in the Ammonia storage drum.  \n\nToxic ARS:\nThe toxic ARS for HF is a release of  HF from a 0.75 inch hole in the acid recycle piping.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Mandan Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Examples of these are the Joint Health and Safety Committee and the Area Safety Committees.  \n \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Mandan Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\nThe refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Mandan Refinery has a compre"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Mandan refinery  uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Mandan Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them in accordance with the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the Mandan Refinery maintains a Safe Operating Limit Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Mandan Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Mandan Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Mandan Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and provides the quality assurance that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mandan Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and"

We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The Mandan Refinery has not had any incidents covered by the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Mandan Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination require"

In addition, the Mandan refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  Personnel are trained on or informed of all changes to the refinery emergency response program that affect them.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mandan Refinery is coordinated with the Morton and Burleigh County Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Mandan Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Mandan Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery. \n \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Mandan Refinery resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned:\n\n\n1. Installing a new security system to provide increased access control to the site and improve personnel accountability.\n2. The refinery is purchasing portable gas monitors (H2S, Ammonia, LEL) for personnel to carry on the process units when it possible they may encounter a hazardous atmosphere. "
