      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of Bay County Utility Services to store, handle, and use chlorine in such a manner as to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the public and the employees at all times.  To achieve this policy, Bay County Risk Management developed Standard Operating and Emergency Procedures for the Use of Chlorine Gas Containers in September, 1994.  These procedures have been refined and updated several times since 1994.  The most recent update of these procedures is included in our RMP submission.\n\nProbably, the most important change to these procedures is the level of training all Water Plant Operators and Mechanics have achieved.  All plant personnel, from the Superintendent level on down, are now HAZMAT Level III certified.  Additionally, four new self-contained breating apparatuses, spare air tanks and threat level \"A\" suits have been obtained.  Since the Water Plant is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week,  there are as a minimum, two trained personnel present and ready to respond to a chlorine alarm/leak.  This will save precious minutes while the Bay County HAZMAT Team is activated to respond to the situation.  \n\nSee the Bay County Standard Operating and Emergency Proceedures for the Use of Chlorine Gas Containers (included) for details on day-to-day use of chlorine containers and response to minor and major chlorine leaks.\n\n\n\n    BAY COUNTY\n\n    STANDARD OPERATING AND \n\n    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES FOR THE\n\n    USE OF CHLORINE GAS CONTAINERS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 1994\nRevised August 24, 1995\nRevised September 18, 1995\nRevised November 28, 1995\nRevised March 4, 1996\nRevised April 30th, 1996\n\nSECTION 1    GENERAL STATEMENT\n\n1.01        Chlorine gas is in use constantly, 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, for the purpose of water treatment.  In its intended usage, it is a very beneficial chemical that protects the general health and welfare of the public.

Thus, the general objective is to contain chlorine to its beneficial usage and to prevent the escape of the gas into the atmosphere.\n\nSECTION 2    PURPOSE\n \n2.01        The purpose of this plan is to establish policy to ensure the safety of the affected County employees and the public.\n\nSECTION 3    BACKGROUND\n\n3.01        Chlorine gas is known as a potential danger to a worker's health in its manufacture and its usage.  As with any other chemical, the more the worker knows and understands about chlorine, the less likely he or she is to have a major problem with the material.  Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant.  In sufficient concentration the gas irritates the mucous membranes, the respiratory system, and the skin.  In extreme cases, difficulty in breathing may occur to a point where death can occur from suffocation.  The characteristic, penetrating odor of chlorine gas usually gives warning of its presence in the air.  Its greenish-yellow color makes it visible at high concentrations.  The gas is more than twice as heavy as air.  The handling and use of both liquid (which exists only when there is sufficient pressure) and gaseous chlorine requires close adherence to safety precautions and procedures established within this plan.\n\nSECTION 4    POLICY\n\n4.01        It is the policy of Bay County to store , handle, and use chlorine in such a manner so as to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the employees and the public at all times.  The hazardous nature of chlorine makes it mandatory that all employees be aware of the proper procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency, and ensure that the emergency measures be conducted in a timely manner. \n\nSECTION 5    EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE\n\n5.01        Periodic inspections by knowledgeable persons should be conducted and documented to assure that the equipment being used with the chlorination system is kept in suitable operating condition.\n\nSECTION 6    CHLORINE GAS ROOM\n\n6.01        Shall be labeled to "

Be careful not bend the whips.  Remove the hoods and subtract the tare weight of the containers from the scale weight--the resulting weight should be around 4,000 lbs.  The valves must be in a vertical position (one valve above the other).\n\n        Step 6:  Make sure the top valve is closed before removing its cap.  Install a fiber washer between the whip and the container valve (FIRST MAKE THE SURFACES ARE CLEAN OR YOU MAY GET A BAD SEAL).

Wait for the pressure gauge to reach zero then close the valve and check connections and the whip for leaks again.

At the sound of the alarm, each employee should secure his/her job and report to the primary assembly area.  If inaccessible, report to the secondary assembly area.  All employees and visitors should be accounted for.  \n\n            Each employee should be aware of any chlorine release and should note the wind direction.  At the first smell of chlorine, move up or across wind until the air is free of chlorine fumes.  If possible, verify that it is an actual alarm and not a malfunction, test, or the result of maintenance.\n\n        b.    Call 9-911 and advise that a chlorine leak has been detected and is being investigated.  Provide a number of minutes within which a confirmation will be made.  If no confirmation is provided within that period, the HazMat Response Team will be activated by the dispatcher.  If there is only one employee responding (e.g. after hours) he should move to safety, activate the HazMat Team and standby. \n\n        c.    Take the necessary steps to secure the area suspected of containing chlorine gas.  Do not, under any circumstances, become exposed to the chlorine.  Ensure all personnel have move to the assembly area.  Following the chain of command, notify management of the situation.\n\n            Shut down all electrical operations that are exposed to the chlorine gas, unless explosion proof.  Instruct personnel to shut off heating/cooling systems to facility buildings.\n\n        d.
