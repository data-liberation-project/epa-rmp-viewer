      "SummaryText": "The Muralo Company, Inc. facility is a 10.7 acre facility located between a partially industrialized and partially residential area of Bayonne, New Jersey.  The facility custom blends and distributes several types of paints (latex and oil-based) and paint products for sale to consumers.\n\nThe facility handles vinyl acetate in the production of a vinyl acrylic copolymer that is used in the production of Latex paints.  Vinyl acetate is regulated under the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Program as well as the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  These regulations require the development of a Program Level 2 Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nVinyl acetate is received in a tank truck and transferred into a double-walled underground storage tank.  Material is pumped to blend tanks for preparation of the batch.  Blended material is pumped to reaction vessels for the batch process.  \n\nAs required by the RMP regulation, Muralo evaluted the potential consequences of two hypothetical release scenarios: a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS).  By definition, the WCS is assumed to be the loss of containment of the largest vessel in the process.  The largest vessel in the process is the storage tank.  However, since the storage tank is an underground double-walled tank, the release rate to the atmosphere, even under worst-case conditions, results in a negligible release rate.  The WCS therefore is assumed to be a total loss of containment of the contents of a blend tank, handing the largest charge of vinyl acetate.  The WCS assumes the entire contents of the blend tank are spilled to a diked containment area.  Using approved EPA models (RMP*Comp), the distance to the specified endpoint was estimated at 0.1 miles.  \n\nThe ARS assumed a failure in the transfer hose during unloading of vinyl acetate from the tank truck into the storage tank.  This scenario assumed vinyl acetate would be released ont"

      "SummaryText": "o the ground into a diked containment area.  Again, using approved EPA models, the distance to the specified endpoint was esimated at 0.1 miles.\n\nNote that the facility has not experienced any significant accidents associated with handling vinyl acetate in the last 40 years.  A significant accident would be one causing some type of off-site impact or on-site injuries or significant property damage.\n\nMuralo has developed written programs and procedures desiged to ensure the safe handling of vinyl acetate, including written standard operating procedures, a maintenance program, a process hazard review, operator training, incident investigation procedures, an audit program, and a management system.\n\nIn addition to the administrative programs described above, Muralo has included several safety features into the facility design.  For example, the vinyl acetate storage tank is equipped with a high level alarm to warn the operators if the tank exceeds prescribed levels.  The tank is also equipped with a separate high-high level interlock.  The high-high level interlock will automatically close the fill valve to stop the transfer on high level.  Similarly, blend tanks are equipped with a high level shutoff switch that will automatically stop a transfer pump if the blend tank level exceeds the prescribed levels.  The reaction vessels are equipped with dual cooling water supply systems to insure back-up supply if necessary.\n\nMuralo has an excellent relationship with the Bayonne City Fire Department, in the event they are needed to respond to an emergency.  The Fire Department conducts a site visit at least once each year.  Muralo also participates in municipal and county emergency response drills on a regular basis.\n\nMuralo recently completed a comprehensive process hazard review designed to minimize the probability of an accidental release."
