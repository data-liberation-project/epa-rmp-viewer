This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facility\u00bfs Hazmat Team, local Fire Department, and the Clayton County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Earthgrains Refrigerated Dough Products operations include the manufacturing of refrigerated bakery products for public consumption packaged under numerous brand names.  Ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system\u00bfs purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for our product. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as discussed in the following text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process."
