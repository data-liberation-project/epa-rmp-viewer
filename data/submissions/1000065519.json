If an accidental release should occur, the facility staff are prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nES - 2.0\tFACILITY INFORMATION\r\nThe Facility is a bulk, hydrocarbon storage and handling facility that receives LPG by tank cars and trucks. The liquefied petroleum gas is stored in the facility's 16 aboveground, pressurized storage tanks prior to being loaded into DOT approved delivery trucks (including those owned by Kiva Energy as well as third-party distributors). \r\n\r\n-The 16 tanks are interconnected into four groups of four vessels. Each group of four tanks is operated as if it were a single storage vessel. Those vessels are\r\n\r\n*  A-Bank-1 : A-Bank-4; \r\n*  B-Bank-1 : B-Bank-4; \r\n*  C-Bank-1 : C-Bank-4; and\r\n*  D-Bank-1 : D-Bank-4. \r\n\r\n-An LPG vapor compressor is used to create a pressure differential between the tank cars or trucks being unloaded and the receiving vessels. The differential pressure \"pushes\" the LPG from the tank cars or trucks into the storage vessels. \r\n\r\n-The LPG stored in the 30,000-gallon, aboveground storage tanks (identified below) is transferred to DOT approved LPG transportation trucks of approximately 11,000 gallons or smaller bobtail LPG delive"

The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a catastrophic release from a full-sized (11,000-gallon\r\nwater capacity), tanker truck. This scenario assumes that the tanker leaks from the bottom mounted entry valve and that the entire contents of the truck are released to the atmosphere. The scenario assumes a complete release of 39,457 pounds of LPG gas. The alternative release scenario would produce a pressure wave with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure that would extend 0.3 miles (0.48 kilometers).

The frequency of the inspection is based upon regulatory framework impacting the particular system or subsystem. \r\n\r\nRMP Change Management (aka Management of Change):  The Kiva Energy Riverbank Terminal employs a change management system that requires changes to various systems or items, such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility functions, be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. This program ensures that the safety of the facility is not compromised by the change. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review:  The Riverbank Terminal conducts a pre-startup safety review prior to the operating equipment or systems following a modification that requires a change in process safety information.
