Toward these ends, chemical processes are subject to ongoing operating scrutiny and routine maintenance.  Station procedures direct employees on proper operation of all critical equipment and systems.  All employees receive training appropriate for the processes, equipment, and materials with which they work, including chemical process safety and proper response to accidental chemical releases.  Station management sets high standards for safety and reinforces its expectations for all employees through annual goals and disciplinary action for non-compliance.  These site measures are supported by corporate policy and the expectation that facilities will meet or exceed all applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements.\n\n\n\nFacility and regulated substance handled:\n\nGibson Generating Station is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Gibson County near Owensville, Indiana.  The power plant combusts coal in large boilers to heat ultra-pure water into steam, which is used to spin turbines connected to electrical generators.  The combustion of fuel creates regulated air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), that move with the flue gas from the boiler through pollution control devices to the power plant stack, from which they are released to the atmosphere.  These air emissions are controlled through federal and state permits.  To reduce NOx emissions, the Station uses anhydrous ammonia in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process.  This process involves injecting ammonia into the boiler flue gas, which then passes through SCR catalyst beds.  The catalyst in these beds promotes a chemical reaction within the ammonia/flue gas mixture in which NOx in the flue gas is reduced and the ammonia and NOx"

      "SummaryText": " are converted into innocuous nitrogen gas (N2, the major component of air) and water.  Liquefied ammonia to be used in the SCR system is stored under pressure in five 70,000-gallon storage tanks.  Gibson Station's Risk Management Plan addresses the storage and handling of ammonia for this SCR process.  \n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nGibson Station has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the ammonia system that meets or exceeds the requirements of both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP, 40 CFR 68).  To ensure safe operation, the ammonia storage and handling system was designed to meet or exceed existing engineering standards and codes.  Safety features of the engineering design include emergency shutdown systems, automatic excess flow control valves, process area ammonia detectors, and a dike system capable of containing a release of up to 110% of the inventory of each ammonia storage tank.  To prevent overfilling, the Station limits filling of each tank to 87.5% of its capacity.  The Station's release prevention program includes practices and procedures for operating and maintaining the ammonia system, conducting incident investigations, training personnel, and managing change.  \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving the ammonia process with offsite consequences since the system was installed in 2001.  \n\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nThe Station's Emergency Response Plan, which meets OSHA Emergency Response Planning requirements (29 CFR 1910.120(q)), has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Gibson County.  All employees with operating responsibility for the ammonia system receive initial classroom training, on-the-job training, and annual computer-based refresher "

A smaller group of employees charged with first response to an ammonia incident, the Station HazMat Team, receives annual OSHA Hazardous Waste Operator training including a full response drill.  In addition, the Station periodically conducts a facility-wide mock disaster drill, coordinated with local emergency response authorities, in which personnel practice evacuation plans.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nTo ensure a safe process, a process hazard assessment (HAZOP) is conducted periodically to review process hazards and consider potential improvements.  The most recent HAZOP did not result in recommendations for design or operating improvements.\n\n\n\n"
