The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment. The City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel will coordinate with local emergency response agencies and first responders to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n2.0 Description of The City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. These substances are:\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:     Chlorine\n\n            Aqueous ammonia (>20% ammonium hydroxide solution)\n\n    \n\nProcess Description: Part of the disinfection process at the Water Treatment Plant includes the use of Chlorine and Aqueous ammonia to form chloramines. When compared to chlorine disinfection, chloramination can provide better protection against certain bacterial regrowth due to greater residual stability than free chlorine alone. \n\n3.0 Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nIn order to aid the RMP Team in accident prevention planning, we have conducted a conservative analysis of accidental release scenarios including modeling, population surveys and environmental assessment of potential consequences. \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full storage"

By evaluating and modeling the potential consequences of these scenarios, we are better able to focus our efforts regarding emergency prevention and response specific to each chemical's hazard.\n\n\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of accidental releases of the aqueous ammonia (>20% solution) from our process. The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. It is important to understand that the City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small. The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes. By identifying these potential releases, the City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for The City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant disinfection process. The following details the prevention program elements at The City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1 Process Safet"

Within this program, the Disinfection Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nTo perform the PHRs, City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHRs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Disinfection Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Disinfection Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Operating Procedures\n\nThe City of Emporia Water Treatment Plant engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Disinfection Process operation should be safely performed.
