The Seminole Gas Processing Plant identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering & Risk Consultants, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for RMP radius of exposure for a 1-psi overpressure. According to the analyses, the maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 724 feet (0.14 miles) from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained  in the Propylene Accumulator storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (80% at 60 degrees F). The maximum distance beyond the plant property boundary is 250 feet, which enters into the Oxy Seminole District pipe yard. Since the plant is located in a sparsely populated area, this worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Occidental Permian.\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the Executive Summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, "

      "SummaryText": "3.5 miles North on state highway 214, Seminole, Gaines County, Texas operates a variety of processes, some of which produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas and natural gas liquids) from an inlet gas stream which is principally carbon dioxide. The plant processes or stores regulated flammables, such as Methane, Natural Gas Liquids and Propylene.  In 2005 the facility conducted process design and hazards reviews for the Yates Fuel Gas Unit to process natural gas and extract the associated liquids. The gas is used to supplement the plant's fuel gas system, while the liquids will be sold via an existing sales pipeline.\n\nIn addition, the plant produces and contains as by-products of processing, Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) at levels below the listed RMP threshold quantities. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nProcesses at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (EPAA?s) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Seminole Gas Processing Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, the Seminole Gas Processing Plant has had no accidental release that caused off site impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  Within the past 5 years the plant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place.\n\nThere was one evacuation due to an unlit flare incident. This is referenced in the 5 year accident history section of the RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Seminole Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities.  \n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe Seminole Gas Processing Plant identified potential candidates for worst case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering & Risk Consultants, Inc of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow program for RMP radius of exposure for a 1-psi overpressure.
