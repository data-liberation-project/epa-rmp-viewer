Regulated toxics and flammable liquids are\nstored in atmospheric tanks. Some products are\nstored in atmospheric tanks with refrigeration for\nproduct quality and vapor pressure requirements.\nStorage tanks and associated equipment are\nconstructed to API, ASME, NFPA, and ANSI standards.\nMechanical integrity inspections and other\ninspections are performed periodically as per the\nstandard(s). MSDS's are required prior to product\narrival and storage for a comprehensive review. The\nreview includes equipments requirements specific to\nthe product, storage tank availability, permit and\nemission control requirements, and any product\nspecific handling requirements. All storage tanks are\ncalibrated and a \"safe fill\" level is determined for\nmaximum inventory. All electrical equipment meet\napplicable electrical codes for flammable service, as\nrequired. Basic operating procedures are maintained,\nalthough some products have product specific\nprocedures. A preventive maintenance program is\nmaintained to provide equipment integrity and safe\noperating conditions. A comprehensive training\nprogram is maintained.
