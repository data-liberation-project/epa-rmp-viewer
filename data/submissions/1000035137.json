This is necessary because as the gas flows through the discharge pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding environment. If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will condense and the resulting liquids will restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe. In extreme cold, the liquids may form hydrates, a potentially dangerous ice plug. \r\n\r\nThe Stations maximum intended inventory of flammable substances in a mixture is larger than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of regulated flammable substances. Therefore, the Station is subject to the EPA RMP Standard\r\n\r\nHistory and Ownership\r\n\r\nThe Frederick Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1980's. The compressor station was sold to Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in 1993 and who maintained operations through December 1, 1999. In 1999, HS Resources bought the station and operated it until 2001.\r\n\r\nIn August of 2001, Kerr McGee (KMG) acquired HS Resources and continued operations until APC acquired Kerr McGee in 2006.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by regulation; however, there are public receptors within the predicted worst case 1 psi over-pressure radius as calculated using the EPA RMP Comp: Analysis program, making this a Program Level 3 facility.  As a level 3 facility, the secondary calculation for a more likely release was determined using a failed load hose during loading operations from the storage tanks on site.  The release was calculated to be a 5minute flow from a 4 load hose before the system could be shut in and isolated- resulting in a 0.2 mile ROE.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summ"

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Anadarko Petroleum Corporation requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the station's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program. This program as well as the other documentation is maintained at the compressor station. In addition, the PSM program requires that process and employee safety issues be addressed as part of normal operations. These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, participation in flow sheet reviews, management of change, and safe work practices.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained compressor station personnel will respond to control and contain the release. All pressures and flows at this facility are monitored 24 hrs./day at our Integrated Operations Control site located in Evans, CO.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Frederick Compressor Station is located 3\u00bd miles west of Ft. Lupton, CO on Hwy 52and 1\u00bd miles south on CR 19.  The Station consists of ten compressors that discharge 85 MMCF/D of gas to delivery points via 16 and 20 pipelines. The discharge pressure is limited to 1,220 psig by the use of automatic shutdowns and relief devices. The station is equipped with two 60,000-gallon inlet slug catchers to separate water and heavier hydrocarbons (called condensate) from the inlet gas stream. These liquids are stored in five 225-barrel storage tanks and hauled from the station via trucks.  There are no toxic chemicals stored or used at this facility.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines.  During this process, it is also necessary to reduce the water dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission. \r\n\r\nThe station receives gas from various gathering lines.  This low-pressure inlet gas is then compressed which causes some of the water and heavier hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream"

The program consists of procedure for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup. In addition the station has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties."

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The compressor station has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals. The compressor station ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) as well as remote monitoring of pressures and flows into and out of the facility.\r\n\r\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation maintains technical documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. The station and its components are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation uses the What If/Checklist or HAZOPS methods of performing process hazards analysis's (PHAs) to evaluate the hazards associated with the process. These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well"

The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. If necessary, the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\r\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained at the area office. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Frederick Compressor Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate. The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Frederick Compressor Station has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in compressor station operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific"
