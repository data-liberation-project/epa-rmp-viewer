The program covers industrial facilities having more than a threshold quantity of certain specified chemicals or flammable substances.\r\n\r\nThe program focuses on chemical release prevention, detection, and accident response, and requires each facility to develop and implement a site-specific risk management plan -- including a hazards assessment, an accident prevention program and an emergency response plan -- by June 21, 1999.\r\n\r\nThis program has been developed for the ammonia refrigeration process at the AGAR Supply Company (AGAR) Taunton, Massachusetts facility to meet the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR Part 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119.  \r\n\r\nAGAR operates a wholesale food supply warehouse and distribution center.  The management team is dedicated to the implementation and management of a successful RMP/PSM program to minimize the risk of incidents to the public and AGAR employees.  Every AGAR employee is trained in safe work practices and dedicated to maintaining a safe work environment.\r\n\r\nIn the event of ammonia leak the system operator has been trained to shut down the system and ensure exhaust fans are operable to minimize the impact of the incident and to call American Refrigeration company.  Employees have been trained to follow the emergency evacuation plan.  \r\n\r\nThe company has contracted with American Refrigeration Company (ARC), inc.1-D Gill st.Woburn Massachusetts 01801 to provide preventative maintenance and 24-hour on-call emergency response.  ARC employees are licensed refrigeration technicians trained under the OS"

Highly efficient screw compressors, evaporative condensers, ammonia pumps, and evaporators make up the system.  Energy savings technologies such as Two Stage Compression, Screw Compressor Unloading, Thermosyphon Oil Cooling, Overd Evaporative Condensers, Hot Gas Defrosting, High Efficiency Motors, Overd Piping, Air Purgers and PC Based Control Systems have all been incorporated into the refrigeration design of the system.\r\n\r\nSafety systems for the ammonia refrigeration system include:\r\n\r\n-\tAmmonia detectors in twenty-six zones fail safe open\r\n-\tManual operation of exhaust fan system\r\n-\tDampers fail safe open\r\n-\tAlarm system connected to fire department indicates ammonia and/or fire\r\n-\tOperations room security access system\r\n-\tTwo King valves for system shut down\r\n-\tWater treatment in place for condensers\r\n-\tSystem remote monitored 24-hours day\r\n-\tSpare pumps in-line in case of failure\r\n-\tAutomatic shut downs in case of pressure/temperature\r\n-\tRelief valves and rupture discs - vent lines alarmed\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system is monitored by a 24-hour off site computer system that alerts personnel if the system is not in normal operation mode.  All ammonia detectors are tied into the local emergency response agency (Taunton Fire Department) and indicate the location and type of emergency.  The Taunton Fire Department has toured the facility with RECCO the original installer to ensure that all members are familiar with the system and know how to respond in case of an emergency. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia compressor room has been designed with a ventilation system to accomplish two major criteria:\r\n\r\n1.\tRemove space heat given off by the refrigeration system equipment \r\n2.\tIn case of ammonia leak within the space remove the ammonia gas from the space at a rate to help reduce levels.\r\n\r\nAmmonia dete"

Ammonia detection will shut down the electrical power and control power in the compressor room at 10,000 ppm\r\n\r\nThe ventilation equipment consists of the following:\r\n\r\n1.\tTwo operable wall louvers for outside supply air to the room\r\n2.\tOne continuous exhaust roof fan - 2800 cfm\r\n3.\tTwo temperature/emergency exhaust fans - 14,000 cfm each\r\n\r\nThe two-temperature/emergency exhaust fans are energized either manually, via a room thermostat or via the Ammonia Detection system.  The wall louvers are opened based on which exhaust fan is energized.\r\n\r\nPressure relief valves are used on the system to prevent over-pressure scenarios.  Rupture discs are installed ahead of relief valves.  Rupture members have a nominal rated rupture pressure not to exceed the design pressure of the parts of the system being protected.\r\n\r\nAgar's RMP/PSM program includes a management of change policy which states that all changes other than ordinary preventative maintenance are documented, reviewed and approved by the process hazard analysis team, ARC and/or Stahlman Engineering as well as the operations manager and company president. \r\n\r\nPSM/RMP training is an on-going process as all new employees are provided with information regarding the program and the emergency action plan.  All maintenance personnel receive training on the operations of the engine room and related equipment, as well as specific process checks required each day. Employees are encouraged to communicate any safety concerns to management and/or Agar's safety committee members.  All concerns are addressed and applicable preventative / corrective measures are implemented."
