Neither of the accidents resulted in EPA-specified off-site effects. \n\nThe first accident occurred in October 1999 in the Number 2 Hydrobon Unit. During a maintenance shutdown, a fire occurred in the unit. The shutdown operation involved cleaning the unit of hydrocarbon using steam. During the steaming operation, an estimated 70 gallons of hydrocarbon and water were released. Vapors from the release ignited resulting in a fire. The fire both damaged equipment and caused burns on two employees. The refinery has revised operating and training procedures as the result of this accident.    \n\nThe second accident occurred in March 2001 in the Alkylation Unit. During a maintenance repair on a pump, a small quantity (approximately 1 gallon) of a mixture of hydrocarbon and hydrofluoric acid solution were released. Vapors from the release resulted in minor burns on two employees servicing the pump. The refinery has revised training procedures and has upgraded personal protective equipment as the result of this accident. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Murphy refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Murphy refinery promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release that caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. The Superior refinery has had no incidents with offsite impacts under the regulation. This is due in part to a commitment to fully investigate even small incident"

(Murphy Superior) Superior Refinery has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our highly trained personnel, working in cooperation with appropriate governmental agencies, will quickly respond to control and contain the release. In the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the refinery, working in conjunction with local emergency management staff, is well prepared to respond and mitigate adverse consequences to the community or the environment. The refinery maintains an accurate and comprehensive emergency response plan. This plan is also maintained in the Douglas County Emergency Government Center. Emergency notification of the public is coordinated through these agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Murphy Oil Superior Refinery, located in Superior, Wisconsin, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products including: fuel gas, propane, butane, fuel oil, and gasoline, from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane as well as hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. Because processes that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP Prevention Program and describes the management system in place to implement"

Specific emergency response procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. Also, the Murphy refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is reviewed when necessary and updated based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Murphy refinery is coordinated with the Superior Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the fire department, the sheriff's office, and state and federal agencies through the Incident Command System. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, government officials, and industry representatives. The Murphy refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate community officials (e.g., the fire department, regional hazmat team) and emergency response organizations through the 911 system. In the event of a release, which so warrants, 911 would be called with information on potential community impact. The local community government and response personnel would then initiate the proper response warranted by the situation. This system provides a means of facilitating quick response to an incident, as well as notifying the public of an incident if necessary.

In the Alkylation Unit, Murphy has added process monitors, a water curtain surrounding portions of the unit, operator-controlled reticulating monitors to fog the area, and a camera system which will allow remote monitoring of any releases and associated response activities. A deluge system has been added to the pressurized storage tank unit to provide cooling to vessels in the event of a fire in that area. Murphy has also developed a community notification system to provide notification of the public in the event of a release. This system informs the public of the proper actions to take in the event of an emergency (i.e. shelter in place, evacuate).\n\nIn addition to those planned changes at the refinery that are related to resolving recommendations from PHAs, the Murphy Oil Superior refinery also is making changes to improve safety at the refinery that are related to further improving site security. These changes include additional lighting and cameras at various points in the refinery to improve monitoring, as well as employing additional guard staff and performing site security training for employees."
