Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEnterprise Products Operating LLC, opeator of the Aux Sable Monee Termninal, is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our response activities are coordinated with local emergency response agencies.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility's primary activity is the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). There are two (2) regulated substances present at our facility. These substances are propane and ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol). Propane is received by pipeline, stored on-site in two storage tanks, and loaded into trucks for distribution in the Chicago area. Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane for safety purposes.\n\nBoth compounds are classified as flammable under 40 CFR Part 68. No compounds classified as toxic are stored or used at the facility in amounts above their threshold quantities.  Details on the quatity of each material stored at the Aux Sable Monee Terminal are included in the registration data elements.\n\n\n3.    Release Scenario(s)\n\n The following paragraphs provided details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from tank storage. The scenario involves the release of the maximum quantity of propane contained in one of the two storage tanks at the facility. It is assumed that the entire quantity is vaporized upon release and is involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  Details on the results of the worst case scenario analysis ar"
