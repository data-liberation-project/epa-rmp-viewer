The regulated chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single \u00c2\u00bfcovered process\u00c2\u00bf for regulatory purposes.  The following regulated chemicals were identified to exceed the threshold quantity (TQ) for regulation under the federal Clean Air Act Accident Release Prevention rule (CAA ARP) or the associated California Regulation (Cal ARP)\n\nFederal:\nChloroform\t\t20,000 lbs\n\n\nCalARP\nChloroform\t\t20,000 lbs\nEthyl Ether\t\t18,000  lbs\nHydrofluoric acid\t2500 lbs\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 205 liter metal drum, is pierced by a forklift and the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  RMP Comp version 1.7, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility that toxic effects may be anticipated, following the chemical release.

Refresher courses for fork lift training and chemical hygiene are currently being updated."
