Occidental Permian assumed operation of the facility from BP America Production Company on November 1, 2010.\n\n\n\nAccidental release Prevention and Emergency\n\n\n\nOccidental Permian Ltd. Is committed to operating and maintaining all of the Block 31 Plant processes (especially regarding the uses of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Block 31 personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Block 31 Gas Plant is a gas processing and pressure maintenance facility located west of Crane, Texas.  The plant processes several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.  Block 31 Plant processes gas produced from the Block 31 field removing natural gas liquids (NGLs) and supply gas for uses as plant fuel and to sales.  Gas enters the plants at pressures ranging from 10 psig to 140 psig.  Compression is used to increase all inlet gas pressures to 800 psig.  Liquids recovered are combined with the field's oil production for sales.  The remaining gas is divided between re-injection and the Nitrogen Rejection Facility (NRF).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nBlock 31 Plant qualifies as a Program Level 1 facility and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM"

Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provide first aid and medical treatment for exposures.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after the evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  We coordinate our emergency response activities with the Crane County, Texas emergency response agencies.  In the event of fire, explosion, or release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the Risk Management Plant (RMP).\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n1.  We will develop and utilize root cause failure analysis methodology in analyzing incidents at \n\nBlock 31.\n\n2.  We will develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental plants.\n\n3.  We will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\n\n\n\nCertification\n\n\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the flammable mixture inventory is"
